here in nz 50 of retailers don’t even have contactless credit card machines like paywave which support apple pay they don’t like the high fees that come with these,0
whenever i go to a place that doesn’t take apple pay doesn’t happen too often it’s such a drag between ‘contactless covid’ habits and my getting the apple card i’ve gotten so used to apple pay that i get seriously annoyed when a store doesn’t take it it feels like a shock it’s crazy how quickly it took over my shopping routine i’ve officially been brainwashed by apple because now it feels so inconvenient to even carry a physical card in my pocket,0
holy crap i was looking at chroma systems back when i was designing power supplies looks like you guys went all out re the multimeter most oscilloscopes are terrible for making accurate voltage measurements 810 bit adcs they are just for looking at the waveforms,0
how does every person wired brings on this show act like theyve been in front of cameras 5000 times,0
his face when describing hops killed me “some of them smell pretty… dank “,0
whenever we get people young enough to actually understand the internet these giant tech companies might be broken up but as long as we have 90 year old senators asking tech ceos how the internet works nothing will get done,0
back in 2018 when john oliver did the episode on corporate consolidation it inspired me so much that i applied for a masters of research program got into a program and did my entire research thesis on tech oligopolies it was shocking to see how bad it really is oligopolies that bordered in monopolies are rampant my research essentially focused on the question of whether lack of enforcement of our antitrust laws caused this whole problem or whether lack of adequate laws were the core of the issue the answer was that it was truly both i thoroughly enjoyed my predoctoral masters thesis and am considering a phd in the future its so lovely to see john talk about this specifically on the tech sector edit wow thanks everyone for the great comments i havent published it yet otherwise i would share it with all you lovely people  i am now looking for a policy or qualitative researchanalyst job so if anyone is hiring let me know ,0
hey something that might interest you a couple of days ago my amazon account was closed with no warning for after hours of wasted time theyre telling me its for excessive returns which i think is an error but thats beside the point when they closed my amazon account all my amazon devices that i own for years primarily all my echo devices stopped working i lost access to the amazon photos and prime video which i pay for so apparently the devices you already own are subject to be disabled by amazon on your perceived shopping habits i assume the same applies to all other amazon devices and services like fire os tablets ring cameras and probably aws as well just wanted to make other people aware of this because they definitely dont tell you this when you buy your hardware and services,0
the fact he didnt buy the nicholas cage spoon is outrageous,0
as somebody with a comp sci degree and a decent amount of irl experience i will say edge computing is problematic at its core because client side workload like this is a huge security breach this is why even online video games avoid client side scripting it is a huge vector for exploit it is always interesting to watch a video like this because you are blown away when you listen regarding these other technologies you may not know allot about but when they cover a technology you know about you realize you must question the quality of the info in the other cases where you cannot determine the quality yourself,0
i was totally shocked that fusion power generation wasnt included possibly as big a leap as quantum computing in its impact on humanity,0
i wish that when people talked about types of skin damage theyd acknowledge what that looks like for people with darker skin we dont get red rashes after sunburn even my darkest bruises are often difficult to spot because of hyperpigmentation the stages of healing for cuts looks vastly different because we dont see the same change in colors around the wound sight not to mention when you look for images to identify clinical signs 99 of those images are of lighter skin and only marginally helpful to us looking to identify potentially serious medical issues,0
my son had botox injections in his legs for years to relax his muscles enough so he could wear splits he has cerebral palsy its crazy knowing that this life changing treatment is also the most dangerous poison,0
my mom wouldve gone nuts for you while i was growing up lol her big parent fear was toxic chemicals and me getting poisoned so she was always lecturing me about stuff under the sink and making sure i didnt touch the pesticides for the farm once she figured out she could call pbs and theyd send her mr yuck stickers the house and barn were covered in them,0
my husband got sun poisoning last year all the symptoms you described it was not fun he said his sick were he got burned felt tight for a few months after luckily he is a nurse and he was able to give me advice on how to help him in his recovery,0
imagine losing the cursor on that screen and trying to find it ,0
one really important point those ionizers can produce potentially dangerous levels of ozone due to the negative ions they create in the air id be cautious of all air ionizers unless they are advertised specifically as bipolar ionizers the one that you recommended does produce ozone which can be very harmful,0
you missed a feature on the airbolt instead of using the big part of the loop to lock your zippers lock the zippers on the loop where the 2 notches are that way you cant open the bag 3 inches,0
i wasn’t prepared for the immediate start lol,0
the whole idea of the interchangeable battery to keep going of the steel series is exactly the reason why xbox still uses aa batteries for their controllers i think is in an undervalued decision from xbox,0
in my experience burnout comes from realizing that improved performance doesnt produce improved rewards it produces more work the response to a job well done is never a couple days off or a timely bonus instead good work is rewarded with the demand for twice as much work in the same amount of time firms see young workers as a productivity sponge to be squeezed for all its worth young people are almost never treated as the companys future,0
i am 50 years old working in the high tech industry mentally tired and sick of the weekly 8 to 5 routine never got a proper day off even through the pandemic hats off to the millenials and genz that think differently and put more weight on living rather than just working,0
i think the pandemic has taught people the importance of multiple streams of income unfortunately having a job doesn’t mean security,0
i worked a low paying tech job for six years and still felt the burn out the problem is that tech is very fast paced and competition focused you can barely keep up though i got promoted regularly my higher ups told me the truth before they left they said that i was severely underpaid based on my skills essentially i branded myself a one stop shop for the marketing department as i am both technically knowledgeable people oriented and strategic i maxed out at 50k so i decided to jump ship with little planned now i run a financial agency with my husband and we make 250k a year as entrepreneurs and we have the freedom to set our own lifestyle,0
those window breakers seems like an easy way to rob someone’s car,0
damn the mueral canvas is nice too pricey,0
if you could limit your products to things that are available retail it would be awesome kickstarter and indiegogo etc dont count too many scams and failed products and no protections,0
that motion alarm for protecting your laptop makes me laugh if you are taking a break away from your workplace do you really think that the alarm feature would deter a thief from simply knocking the device to the floor pick up the laptop and perhaps step on the alarm and crush it in a moment of disdain by the time you get back with your latte after your phone notifies you of your impending bad luck your laptop will be off on an extended trip,0
the trene control alarm will not deter someone who really wants it they will just knock that gadget off and run with your property,0
i spent hours researching dash cams a year or so ago and it’s almost maddening how awful sparse and misrepresented information on dash cams is i was totally surprised how under developed they are this is a video that is really necessary,0
when i went looking for a dashcam my main criteria was that it has a super cap instead of a battery cause i really dont think the batteries would handle the 20 to 30c temps in winter and the exact opposite in the summer along with however much the sun heats up the interior i know you can take them off but i kinda wanted an install and forget about it kind of system for actual performance its much better to just find someone elses footage cause the resolution and other specs are very misleading unless you really know your camera sensor specs,0
i had my suspicions about this for a long time thank you for finally calling this issue out it sounds like theres a hole in the market for a truly high quality dashcam thats not chinese crap hopefully some tech company sees this and swoops in im tired of all these countless trash brands on amazon with unpronounceable names,0
ive been wanting to make this video for such a long time that royole display was just so hard to get hold of by holy cow was it worth it to check out my other ridiculous tech unboxings,0
reminder do not fall for the fake telegram and whatsapp accounts trying to have you claim a prize through texting them its fake and a scam i personally contact the winners through my official account only,0
teachers there are no stupid questions wolfgang puck well tracey thats a stupid question,0
the price of todays bikes is absolutely bonkers doesnt make any sense whatsoever if you compare it to motorcycles or even cars,0
the price of the roadgoing kawasaki really tells how overpriced the push bikes are,0
as a lapsed superbike obsessive it always bothered me hearing gcn call top road bikes superbikes now i mostly watch cycling and im used to it,0
oppo did oneplus so dirty  heart breaks for oneplus fans rip oxygen os and oneplus,0
man oneplus is in the wrong direction after carl pei left from flagship killer to forgettable company,0
lots of profit negative tech startup companies with an over abundant of overpaid employees…honestly who hasn’t seen this coming,0
what slowdown lol it was abnormally fast and now with the recession vcs realized many of these startups aren’t profitable so they laid off people the big ones are still hiring and tech adoption isn’t nearly as much for it to slow down anytime soon,0
slow hirings may be caused by a rapid rising labor cost in hi tech ind,0
thats really a problem with service economy most tech companies dont even produce a nail they do things that are intangible you cay easily live without them if netflix goes down i am sure there will not be any catastrophic event if some manufacturing companies goes down lets say the one that makes baby formula it could trigger a panic,0
it still blows my mind that companies have entire teams deciding whether or not a flavor is going to appeal to the masses and yet somehow swedish fish flavored oreos were still greenlit,0
when i was a kid in kindergarten we did an experiment with that old fake five flavors taste zones thing and i never got it i could always taste everything on every part of my tongue i felt vindicated like two decades later when it came out that that was horsecrap but i cant exactly go rub it in my kindergarten teachers face can i,0
honestly my main take away is that ive been saying tinnitus wrong my whole life,0
the universal hate for printers is what unites humanity,0
im just shocked and saddened that theyve ignored the most significant vacuum cleaner advance the retractable cord,0
i can confirm her squirrel facts i raised an orphaned one and it was the sweetest cuddliest pet until it almost grown woke up one morning an she acted like a wild animal biting scratching trying to eat my face off it was a sad day but ive checked wanting a squirrel off my list,0
i swear to god every can i have this exotic pet question can just be answered with the words do you know what domestication is and how long it takes,0
declawing cats stop calling it declawing it has nothing to do with the claws as the vet said it is amputating the toes cats have claws if you have a problem with claws dont get a cat,0
thank you for addressing declawing cats and how awful and hurtful it is to the cat,0
i have a cat who was declawed by a previous owner he has so many behavioral issues that are typical of declawed cats he was just at the vet yesterday for litter box issues and the vet brought up the fact that he was declawed declawing inflicts lifelong trauma on the animal,0
exotic animals as pets should be illegal tigers dont belong in farms sugar gliders dont belong in apartments sad to see that this happens still,0
askgcntech after two years of running tubes i finally went tubeless a couple of months ago i managed to puncture my tyre the other day sealant didn’t do the trick nor did a couple of slugs even tried a patch inside the tyre the puncture was not on the sidewall and may have been 3mm large given the tire had plenty of life left i am gutted that i may have to discard the tire now when would you come to a decision that a tubeless tire is ko,0
another problem with filling tires with water is that the first bump you hit will probably cause the tire to blow off the rim water is incompressible unlike air so it has to go somewhere when the tire volume gets changed due to an impact,0
askgcntech as a heavier rider i feel i’m always in the max range of gears either hardest gear on flat’sh roads or my easiest gear when i see any sustained gradients i currently run a compact chain set with a 1230 cassette on the rear would i benefit from upping my chain set to give me more usable gears or would this just make my climbing problem even worse due to the worse range at the rear,0
when someone tells a lie deep down they know this is wrong they have no compassion,0
when you as an employee are fired from a company and the reasons they are giving you are “poor performance or lack of culture fit” trust me when i tell you the real reasons are not disclosed been there done that companies lie hr works for the company and also lies and a corporation hierarchy matters when you lawyer up is when they start taking you a bit more seriously,0
all the musk haters who said he was doing this for laughs are salty rn,0
most tech companies let things like this slide all the time…,0

“once you spend 5 to 10 grand on magic cards you kinda don’t wanna pay for them anymore” really hits home for me,0
just a note on the screw driver put some extended bits with it or a smaller precision screw driver in the set with it its very common for some screws to be deep in a hole and having those small bits into hex end wont go in far enough down the hole to extract screw i see this allot on laptops controllers that kinda thing sunk in screws suck,0
arun this product killed over a hundred people also arun 7 out of 10,0

great to see you including a wider variety of stuff in these videos beyond just electronic devices especially the pharmaceutical industry if youre going to include banned medications then the top of the list in your next video should be thalidomide what it did was absolutely tragic it was banned decades ago yet people are still suffering and living with severe disabilities to this day thousands of families destroyed and lives lost too,0
there was also another problem with the fitbit when some of the straps would irritate your skin and leave a rash and still the company hasnt dealt with it yet,0
1035 this is a common misconception while part of the reason was the battery being too thin the main issue was a manufacturing defect in the corner of most of the batteries at launch which was a tiny dent in the top left corner this would cause the battery to eventually short out as the dent caused both terminals to eventually touch each other most peoples phones were exploding while fast charging which was likely due to the increased power going through the battery and lithiumion batteries do not take well to being shorted out like that edit normally defects of that scale would be perfectly fine and would never cause issues but they made the battery too thin meaning it shorted it out easier just wanted to clarify that,0
last week they said to sell it all now they say buy glad i never listen to these frauds,0
for those who are curious not only is it widely accepted that an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs but we also know exactly where the asteroid landed its called the chicxulub crater its located on the northern coast of the yucatan peninsula and has been carbondated to have formed in that time period and it size of the crater certainly looks catastrophic enough,0
the way he factually states the world is a sphere makes you feel like hes heard even weirder statements before and this is just another misconception he corrects ,0
the biggest problem is colleges charging outrages tuition fees causing this to happen,0
so everyone who couldn’t afford college will have to pay for those who did……why not make college affordable in the first place,0
now we need to cap these institutions no more predatory pricing honestly these collegesuniversities should be paying back people the interest as well those who have and have not paid off their loans last 30 years included,0
regulate college tuition so that this doesn’t happen again please otherwise this will be pointless,0
when colleges knew about this watch them charge more tuition then you will know why college is expensive in the first place,0
he needs to find a way to get schools to lower their tuition rates and quit trying to game a broken student loan system this will just keep happening and its not going to stop idealistic young people from taking out massive debt on a useless degree the schools need to be regulated if they take govt funds then they should be subject to immediate regulation,0
the states deregulated tuition and fees so the colleges could charge more then they used that money to hire more administrators and build more buildings the students are not just paying for their education they are also paying for all the things the colleges wanted but the states did not want to give them money for nobody talks about that,0
there is no such thing as loan cancellation its merely a transfer do people not understand how this works,0
im trying to hold onto hope and positivity for new york state but every year it gets harder and harder,0
nadler shouldnt be allowed to drive much less wield power,0
funny how democrats always choose the old white man lol,0
a population of mass psychosis,0
it never matter how win the question is is the state is any better under either politicians all politicians are very corrupt,0
ny democrats never cease to amaze me…picking the absolute worst representatives possible thanks jim eagle,0
i feel for civilians that just want to live a peaceful normal life in ukraine,0
to be clear its not alleged war crimes they have tried and convicted people for them already so yes war crimes are being committed in ukraine just because you dont like saying it doesnt change that its actually happening to the people it affects,0
i whole heartedly agree with the guy from nato who was saying that europe and the us will pay a high price this winter for supporting ukraine this winter but not supporting them will cost us even more the biggest threat to ukraine right now is that the rest of us will lose interest and abandon them ukraine needs to get all their territory back or russia is just going to eat them in bites and then they will move to the next nation that they want to add back to the soviet union,0
happy independence day to ukraine and glory  the reason why i support ukraine because i’m human and i support human rights and if ukraine surrenders there will be no more ukraine and it won’t save lives it will only end up in a brutal occupation like bucha irpin and mariupol massacre the main goal of russia is that they want to destroy ukraine as a nation just like rome destroyed carthage russians don’t treat ukrainians as people,0
do you remember what happens when we give unaccounted money and weapons to countries to fight proxy wars we keep making the same mistakes over and over,0
notice how the guy calling in keeps saying we in regards to ukraine weird,0
our government should be held accountable for the pointless expense on this war they already have genocidal turkey helping them and they will still lose at the end all this money could have gone to peoplegovernment took 6 months with vacations to send us measly dimes during covidbut billions they send at a whim,0
i hate to say it but i don’t think the ukrainians are going to be able to counter attack remember ukraine uses 5000 artillery shells a day russia on the other hand is using 500000 shells a day russia has the most tanks in world there isn’t a shortage of there wasn’t a shortage then how come luhansk has fallen let’s not get ahold of ourselves,0
saddakur incoming when he can’t deliver the sheer overconfidence they project as underdogs is off putting not in touch with reality,0
russia is being beaten at highspeed attrition warfare it is alarming how russia is throwing away its best lives and equipment  victory to ukraine ,0
always remember this you cant operate an army without supply trucks also fuel trucks destroy or capture all russian trucks 1 are they armored no 2 do they have heavy weapons on them no 3 is a army truck driver a high skilled soldier no 4 puncture truck tires or damage the engines,0
to be good at something you got to be doing it all the time why do you think the americans are so good at war,0
happy independence day to ukraine and glory  the reason why i support ukraine because i’m human and i support human rights and if ukraine surrenders there will be no more ukraine and it won’t save lives it will only end up in a brutal occupation like bucha irpin and mariupol massacre the main goal of russia is that they want to destroy ukraine as a nation just like rome destroyed carthage russians don’t treat ukrainians as people,0
as a former combat planner in vietnam i agree with general hodges putins attrition strategy is not well thought out firstly they dont have the right equipment manpower or time ukraine has all of that except for equipment in sufficient quantities over time the wests resources will help ukraine fill that gap,0
europe is forever in debt for the bravery of ukraine hopefully russia shall pay to rebuild ukraina slava,0
i feel like i’m in a simulation at this point,0
i got 25 seconds in and already call bullsht i paused the video to comment but started reading other comments i was amazed because every comment shows disdain for our media including cbs news smh caused me to forget my original and now meaningless thought,0
is he just hiding documents in doughnut boxes im so confused,0
being a politician should not be a career choice term limits for everyone,0
term limits is a must tired of these crooked cryptic politicians retire,0
whats shocking is how many people like this guy pretty disgusting,0
hes more detached from the people he represents then any representative in us history,0
all of this does nothing to correct the problem of high college tuition schools will continue to leverage off government loans and at the same time increase tuition to pay for their exorbitant pensions the cycle continues,0
i didnt realize up to 250k per family is consider low income people making way less than that will be paying for his forgiveness plan this administration is insane,0
everyone knows money doesnt mean anything anymore unless you have some the govt can take,0
as far as the weather this is absolutely crazy what is going on my deepest thoughts and prayers are with everyone across the globe who is in a danger zone and experiencing such hardships,0
i dont care how many cops there they are not going in to protect ussoooo sad,0
it’s either floods droughts or wildfires actually it’s all of them simultaneously 2030 years from now we might actually start to think seriously about reducing emissions but i doubt it,0
which means the taxpayers will have to foot the bill,0
going to be a lot of people upset when they realize what this does to the economy,0
so people who paid their debt off just as people who immigrated to usa legally are slapped in the face by people who cannot or will not pay their debt,0
forgiveness means the debt goes away never to be seen nor heard of again this is robbing peter to pay paul,0
this administration is starting to remind me of a time in history called the taxation without representation taxes taxes taxes biden and harris,0
thats so weird hes been screaming he wanted transparency the whole time and now he doesnt want anybody to look at the documents he stole,0
first the documents weren’t there then the documents were planted and now he wants to ban them what a joke,0
simple as this these documents do not belong to him and never did demanding they be returned when they shouldn’t have been in his home in the first place is ludicrous,0
trumps a modern day obstructionist especially about things and issues that can convict him,0
so first he never had it then the cult cried “planted documents” now he did have it but thinks it’s his………you can’t make this stuff upindict indict indict and indict ,0
this video is not for children its shocking alltimeml mr dunn respect to you,0
one asinine move after another from the trump team concerning the searchandseizure i guess trump didnt get the memo that he no longer has enablers in congress or at the doj to bail him out,0
how can reporting on this be so bad the president has the authority to declassified documents not a single one of those documents is classified… do better,0
only trump would call a search warrant unwarranted,0
these people spending all this time and money to try to find dirt on trump is getting old,0
allegedly they say this to avoid being sued learn how words work,0
if he was up to something he would have declassified them when he had the power this is as stupid as the ones getting tickled about this raid,0
they really just dont want him to rerun for presidencyhes not in the club,0
here’s one for ya… if they were so important and they did know about this since he left office… why wait 1 12 years to get the warrant especially in an election year mind blown stop being sheep,0
cosatu is trying to manipulate the people of south africacyril said before the prices rosehe said he discussed that with stake holders and labour unionswhy cosatu and saftu are marching now does this means they are not satisfied with the cost of living or they want to see how many south africans reacts,0
shluggishness to start the protest that could be a problem in our work environment as well lets try to be more in time for work and work with greater vigour to make this a nicer country to live in,0
every year during the month of june and august they is a reason for people to lose jobs these unions are getting paid for this disorder,0
i thought foreigners are the ones earning below ,0
but all of you are the same people that wanted a new south africa why you complaining when you got a new south africa,0
when u are unhappy with the current situation u dont further destroy whats left of the economy but u can cut ties with the anc and put your hat in the ring in 2024 its as simple as that,0
,0
our legal system is broken loopholes exist that allow the wealthy to avoid the sort of jail time that would have been inflicted on someone who cant afford elite lawyer representation i get sick of it but im not sure what a challenge to the status quo would look like,0
how long will we allow this clown to continue thses charade its embarrassing to the nation and democracy no one else would even come close to being tolerated,0
it is impossible to simply walk off with these documents and keep them in order to do that you have to purposely want to take them away i cant understand it mick mulvaney,0
first he wanted it out now he don’t so typical of him,0
our greatest concern is that biden remains in office for another five minutes,0
we defeated the wrong enemy now they are destroying us from within,0
if you still vote for brandon after all this you’re beyond trying to reason with,0
it is a shame that ben has to go behind joe and clean up his terrible policies,0
if you say this is the worst choice you can imagine its guaranteed that thats exactly what this administration will do,0
“leave them alone” i absolutely agree another example of the federal government f ing things up,0
if its a dangerous threat to americans and a bad deal you can be sure biden will agree to it,0
yes the airlines should pay for hotels food transportation from and to airports full refunds they make billions on all if us and we get to sleep in the airports floors  yes make them all responsible for their mess ups,0
airlines need to stop taking money for services they cannot render,0
“there’s no way to enter a serial number and search for the owner” how are we ever supposed to stop gun violence with a stupid law like that,0
sorry for the 16 year old my child at 16 yrs could not be out partying at 12 midnight no way no how hate me now love me later,0
just knowing that first responders took pictures and shared them with friends would cause me major distress just because they werent on social media doesnt mean the public didnt see them i hope she wins big and they are forced into reprimanding the staff along with making policy changes,0
the market has been pretty bad until today it decided to surge everybody was practically crying then it kept dipping thats what you get when you feel you can navigate the process on your own big thank to hilder ferguson im not bothered with how bad the market is because my assests are insured due to her advice and i still receive my profits,0
not only on the wrong track but off the rails chuck,0
conveniently leaving out voters opinions on the media by far the worst of the institutions,0
why would they be angry they voted for it,0
if you read barbara walters how civil wars start you would know that there are two issues that lead to violence anocracy and factionalization democracies dont fight nor do authoritarian states its the transition from one system to the other where the hazards are found thats anoncracy factions in the book means when people sort themselves by ethnic or sectarian attributes rather than policy preferences and this sorting creeps into their entire lives weve been on that course since the tea party started the only cure is doubling down on democratic participation the gop is pointedly not doing that anywhere theyve got their hands on the controls we are being steered right for the ditch so im glad at least one in five of us say thats the 1 problem we face,0
wage slavery during the apocalypse polls poorly who would have guessed,0
21 making  74 struggling,0
most important issue too much money in politics we desperately need campaign finance reform,0
do a poll to see who is responsible for all of this one single man with only his own personal interest has done all of this,0
who does not have any principle is nitish,0
wtf ak47,0
it’s really unfortunate that the intended target was missed,0
rip to the toyota lancruiser also killed in the bombing it would have reach a retiring million km mark with proper motor oil transmission oil and gear cases maintenance it will be missed by the local dealership mechanic,0
i feel so bad for the victim of that bombing my heart goes out to the car,0
sucks to suck dugin unfortunate a car was destroyed in the process,0
slava ukraini i really hope that mr dugin knows what the pain is when losing your shared ones like all the parents in ukraine who lost daughters sons babiesmom and dad during that sad war,0
the ignorance of the people vilifying someone who tragically was assassinated is asinine also doesnt help when you realize that russia is using her death as a franz ferdinand moment so yeah keep vilifying til your world ends not a threat an analyzation with this russia wont stop til ukraine falls,0
i’m dead serious about this he switched cars at the last second now why would he do that felt his safety was in danger something doesn’t add up about all this,0
i feel bad for the daughter not for the father,0
the case was brought to federal court only to have another year of freedom his side clearly had no proper counter arguments from the start pity the court of having to deal with this drama,0
imagine a prime minister this corrupted can you think of the people in his circle,0
fair and transparent trial and appeal despite vile attempts to delay and frustrate justice,0
the court had done its job now the rakyats turn if bn wins the next pru itll likely be that they ask for royal pardon to free him itll be difficult to know if agong will grant it seeing this is a serious crime of trustworthiness and integrity we do not know its our job to make sure bn has no such opportunity,0
my friends were there last night fucking props to those that called it in,0
this is terrifying a couple days ago i was just talking to my friend who went to a music festival where the security didnt even check bags she was kinda scared how an event like that could easily be the target of mass shooting,0
so sorry about mr engles son condolences to the family,0
ill be so glad when the whole trump drama is over 5 years of a bad play is too much for any audience member to endure,0
so sorry for richard and his family i hope they find the strength they need to go through this process,0
when money plays out those millionaires have many ways to evade prosecution but when poor people get in trouble they are doomed,0
i heart goes out to richard engel i am literally crying my eyes out right now and yes i’m a man it is so sad for our own richard to lose his son i’m so sorry for your lost richard i hope you take some time off and be with your family god bless you and your family ,0
airlines intentionally mislead customers it’s discussing they got a high amount of money from the government and now they over books all flights,0
thank you pete planning a trip and missing a wedding or a funeral no excuse for over selling every flight they need to factor weather in the schedule,0
i worried because my grass is dead wow you arent ready for this world lady,0
all wars are terrible but honourable in defence of ones country slava ukraine,0
you’re in the middle of a ground invasionoccupation of a neighboring country and don’t feel even a little ridiculous complaining that someone ruined your navy parade ,0
how dare they defend themselves after being invaded whats the world coming too ,0
gota pohora natey kala rata kawa ,0
the cdc was only partly to blame our forprofit healthcare system also failed us as iit does every day,0
cdc couldve responded whatever way they wanted but as we all saw during the pandemic too many people would have simply not cared heck it was too much for them to even wear a mask,0
didn’t need the cdc to make that announcement we knew they didn’t do their job,0
a country is not great until it can protect all its people with free healthcare is pence feeling the heat getting closer sorry about cheney wyoming got its priority really wrong,0
006 this is how we ukrainians feel when your missiles fly over us all the time watching our fellow friends and family die at your hands,0
someone wanted to take him out but ended up hurting him one million times more,0
it hurt ha now the father can feel the pain he likes to influenced,0
he has lost what is most precious to himself his no claims bonus,0
well he now knows how the families of the victims of the novichok attack feel in britain,0
he’ll probably blame everyone else but himself after immersing himself in hatred he will probably be genuinely perplexed as to why anybody might want to kill them,0
instant karma feel the pain of many ukrainian fathers who have lost their sons and daughters in ukraine this is much painful than being assassinated,0
the fear he and others with him will suffer every time he gets into a car now,0
its tragic that someone loses their life like that but dont forget that one violence is the cause of another violence the young womans father propagated violence and now it came back to him with violence against his family use your brain violence is always the worst option,0
itll never hit home till it actually hits home for some people,0
wowat same time i had flooding inside my house in caribbean pushing flood water out my mind went on gratitude that others have it worse not knowing same occuring simultaneously i hope all recover quickly,0
when the land is hit by heat waves and dries water usually cant get in and thats a recipe for floods when it rains,0
this is what happens when we continue to neglect the environment when our lakes are drying up the only way to stop future tragedies like this is to get on top of our climate issues,0
yes my fellow texans stay alert because if anything happens we are on our own abbott will likely spend 5 mins blaming the windmills then go back to his cocktail party while millions go without drinking water,0

6 monthsand at times we had to be reminded a war was going on,0
rumi a 13th century persian philosophers view on wars wars like childrens fights are meaningless pitiless and contemptible,0
have you considered why somehow the war should not be taken onto russian territory or russians should be in any way immune from the horrors of the war of conquest that russians have started the trillions in damage the russians have done to ukraine in terms of infrastructure and lost economic output the 10s of thousands of people theyve killed the millions of people theyve displaced,0
but its okay to invade ukraine but once russia is getting attacked its a crime,0
wars are worst things in life and sadly we keep continuing same mistakes because of bloody old politicians who thirst for wars for their interests and leave people die all governments are involved in world and no one is innocent imagine no wars everywhere and peace but that is impossible because evils surround us,0
the problem with this that by focusing on totally different thing rather than better content we subscribers are paying the price with increasing subscription fee,0
netflix in a lot of trouble now especially as more market competition comes in from other distributors this move into gaming will not do them any favours,0
the reason netflix is struggling is because they keep losing content their own content when its good is constantly neglected and they keep raising the price without adding commensurate value to justify it getting into games demonstrates that they are not recognizing what theyre doing wrong and simply trying to find a new source of revenue instead of fixing their faults people are getting sick of having the price increased while more and more good content disappears or takes far too long to update people are used to getting the next season of a series once every year but many of them are taking 2 to 3 years to release even before covid,0
this is the problem with these big companies their core offering starts to fail and they think moving focus elsewhere is the answer instead of making sure their core offering is decent,0
i worked in retail for most of my life and the one thing i have never forgotten is the fact that once you lose a customer you are going to play hell trying to get them back regardless of what you do,0
i think it’s so silly that netflix feels the need to compete with youtube and tiktok i think these platforms should be able to exist together in harmony as they each offer very different products eg people can follow along with reactionsreviews and video essays while watching a netflix series people also don’t typically like when youtubers are given a large budget like with youtube red originals so netflix buying out certain youtubers is not the right idea…,0
im surprised getting all the collectibles didnt even get an honorable mention theres been more than enough people who couldnt 100 the arkham games simply because they didnt like the riddler trophy collecting quest especially arkham knight due to how many times you had to use the batmobile just for those collectibles,0
the one that annoyed me was the borderlands 1 when to obtain you had to play online with someone from gearbox or with someone who already had the trophy they changed it for the rerelease to playing with three players at once,0
the original infamous hurt my soul i played through the campaign twice on hard to get the platinum only to find out while i was doing cleanup that the stunt master trophy cant be completed post game i had all but one stunt to knock 3 enemies off a roof at once when you clear out an area enemies no longer spawn in large numbers therefore there isnt enough enemies to get the stunt i didnt have it in me to start another campaign the sad part is i had tried the stunt on multiple occasions only for it to glitch and not award the stunt,0
ac3 was super annoying when first released because of having to pass the mission the first time without any retry problem was the controls were clunky af and the goals of the missions most of the time were annoying or without too much logic like do not touch water,0
multiplayer trophies tied to the platinum will always always be the worst,0
so glad you did multiplayer awards lumped with single player awards that is the biggest bullshit for single game players that dont want to listen to children screaming neck beards eating or just racist hateful crap just for a trophy,0
really addictive i dont believe it and im still here ,0
the only unrealistic part is having consistent connection with very little delay because even in this decade big pings and lags is still a common occurences,0
impossible nothing like that could ever be made,0
implying that this insult has been passed down for decades quickly we must continue the legacy,0
i used to preorder games to get the “collectible” toy that was sought after the items got really cheap really fast not worth it they also tell you that there may not be enough copies that never happened there was always enough copies,0
i wish developers would realize that forced drm and internet connectivity for games is a step backward look at the debacles gt7 and simcity have endured whats the point of paying a full 70 for the game if there is no guarantee you can play it at your leisure especially if this ridiculous requirement is in place for singleplayer modes in my opinion at that point you cant help but wonder if spending time with the game is either fun or just another full time job this is not why people play games,0
i havent bought a game on release for the past 6 years now the gaming industry has changed for a while now and its only getting worse i buy 34 games per year at most and usually heavily discounted quality multiplayer games are a rarity nowadays cod and battlefield lost their way quality single player games are still a thing but are often filled with bugs on release so i wait it out and buy goty editions usually and often second hand gotta love disc edition systems i refuse to fuel bad descions made by money hungry devs or publishers,0
this video made me a bit sad made me realise how the industry has changed and not for the better i have young children so can’t game like i used to but when i do have time i find myself increasingly drawn back to older games that i’ve played before but adore the vast majority of new games just don’t appeal to me as for the new gen consoles…what’s the point all they seem to be doing is rereleasing older gen games yawn,0
technically ramp buggy isnt suppose to be used as an offroad vehicle it is a street vehicle thats classified as offroad because its pretty much a buggy with a ramp on its hood to windshield,0
you should do an offroad test with all the trucks in the swamp next to the military base,0
i cant beleive how consistent agn has been for years now,0
i think we’ve reached the point that these devs need to come up with better idea and aí for decades now they just been able to make games look better a lot of games are actually worse gameplay wise with stale ideas and dumbed down mechanics than older games,0
post game depression never really hit me until undertale and now every chapter of deltarune i dont know if its because im getting old and soft or if theyre just that good,0
2nd meme i have tainted such an innocent soul,0
as a person who very rarely plays console and hasnt owned one for over 3 years i can very much relate to not knowing where the buttons are my friends are all going ok now just press rt then lt then a and go left and im there constantly checking where the buttons are right top left top a and left,0
i thought it was just me with the end of game depression it hits hard,0

that saints row reboot looked disappointing from the start its a shame it turned out that way in the end we will always have saints row 2 and the third,0
theory karl is trying to help the player but like the mothman it brings destruction and death,0
theory karl is a creation made by the dev that was supposed to help you but has gone wrong and is trying to hunt the players and scare them,0
the bass line in the beginning really giving me shivers,0
the fake slide is unfair to the defense you pursue that and get penalized as a defender,0
for people complaining on the fake slide it was absolutely legal at the time of the play and was a glaringly awful loophole in the rules it was changed as a direct result of that play,0
“conte once a chelsea friend now a devoted foe” that was colddddd ,0
i dont see many commenting on the foul that took havertz down and led to spurs first goal that should have been a card and a free kick it was clearly a foul in the replay no wonder tuchel was so steamed for the rest of the match,0
i was never good at sports sis we all felt that,0
you know a canadian made this list when a damn curling highlight makes the cut,0
1442 this is the most painful one on this list if you ask me out of all the premature celebrations out there resulting in losses this ones just different the game was over lol its not like someone tripped you up before getting a touchdown the game is literally over all you do is hold onto the ball for a couple seconds and thats it the washington wizards were up by 3 at that point even if the apposing team has time to foul you you hit just 1 free throw and its over even if you miss both they have to somehow rebound the ball and go for a full court shot to tie the game in an impossible amount of time long story short that throw lost them the game after ot lol just look at his fellow teammates staring at him in total disbelief afterwards gotta be one of the worst throws in sports history,0
d hop breaking his ankles literally was by far the most savage,0
440 isnt even the whole story the last time giancarlo stanton faced fiers he hit him in the face ending his season and prompting reconstructive surgery thats the reason he and now many baseball players wear face flaps on their helmets the very next time they face off he hits him again even if unintentional thats nuts,0
i feel like most people watching this video have 0 idea how unbelievable it is that they were allowed to even be at augusta before the masters let alone play all sports golf there,0
114 no sport event anywhere in history can come near this one god himself,0
the last one wasnt great its a foul in footballing terms and always results in a yellow card other players have done the same and been booked for it too as did henry in that last clip,0
if this guy calls zlatan “zlatan” one more time,0
canelo and plants speech gave me the chills man he was truly sad he lost the fight,0
dave winfield of the new york yankees accidentally hit and killed a seagull with a baseball in toronto vs the blue jays august 1983 he was charged with cruelty to animals and an autopsy was even done on the seagull it created a lot of controversy here in toronto,0

the right side of the midfield is gonna be an absolute quagmire went right over my head,0
3 games in to the season might seem like a bit too soon to be worried about this liverpool team but the early indications are that the liverpool midfield is literally paper thin when it comes to resources as a long time lfc supporter i cant help but compare the decision to let sadio mane go to the same situation with xavi alonso some years back i think that j klopp is going to have to put in some serious time working with this squad to get anywhere close to a top 4 position this year hope i am wrong but if i am being honest man utd should have been 40 up at halftime,0
they missed manè and nobody wants to admitted sorry,0
three weeks in and the table is unrecognizable,0
if liverpool dont sign at least 2 players midfielders before the transfer window closes making top 4 will be very difficult and as for vvd looks like he is getting too complacent this season,0
perisic has brought so much offensive danger to the wings for spurs which is deadly considering someone of kanes quality waiting for those headers,0
i feel as though spurs is not overwhelmingly great compared to other top teams in bpl but what makes them so deadly is their continuous pressure and effort which shows around 2nd half,0
it’s crazy how much haaland can affect the game even with few touches his runs are always pulling players and opening up space for city to play once they start getting used to him being there for tap ins too it’s gonna be even scarier,0
foden cant do that bs that was a tap in for haaland,0
adam smith should have been given a red card,0
if i was haaland would have been pissed at foden too,0
honestly you can’t even be surprised that bauer acts the way he does he grew up bullied by kids and adults who always told him he was nothing and worthless that shit stays with you,0
will you make people stop cheating no alright then im just going to openly use the method of cheating and tell anyone and everyone,0
as someone who was bullied heavily as a kid i can see theres a few outcomes of that sort of situation and one of them is people become complete antisocial assholes like bauer,0
he literally said i’m going to cheat too if nobody wants to stop everyone else he was the one who made it so public and now we have umpires checking all the time,0

doesn’t matter who we buy at this point once they’re here they’ll regress beyond recognition,0
i think casemiro is a quality player and a quality singing i don’t believe he’ll be ‘unmotivated’ because he’s won everything he’s a world class cdm which we need but it’s madness that we’ll be paying that money for him at this point in the window crazy it reeks of absolute desperation,0
quality player is casemiro also a dm which weve cried out for the concern with this signing though is how much more motivation will he have to still achieve having won everything multiple times over at madrid we are said to pay him an eyepopping 400k a week is what ive heard thats typical united one of our biggest problems has been paying insane wages resulting in comfortable unmotivated players who we then cant move on when its time as i say quality player but just seems like one that may help to stabilise us a bit more again but wont helps us achieve anything substantial as for pulisic ive always been quite underwhelmed by him albeit you can see he does possess good quality i probably wouldnt be averse to a loan though it cant be any worse than banging our heads against a brickwall hoping rashford does anything productive every week,0
we are a absolute mess if casemiro was the target why wasnt he signed 2 months ago we just panic and buy whoever with no strategy man im not saying casemiro is a rubbish player he is quality its just man utds approach to signings is a joke plus im not overly keen on giving a 30 year old a 5 year contract at 250k a week but ill literally take anything over scott and fred,0
united have 2 big transfer problems right now 1 literally everyone in football knows how bad the situation is at united and it means alot of good players are simply going to refuse to go here regardless how much money we offer them haaland is a good example 2 the players we can get the clubs they play for know how desperate we are and are naturally gonna jack up the price to get as money money as possible,0

actually if its currently september 1914 and he left 67 days ago that would have been a week or two after arch duke franz ferdinand was assassinated and an englishman like friend wouldnt have known a fullblown world war was about to clack off since austriahungary wouldnt declare war until a few weeks until after he set sail,0
this guys body language tells me that he is uncomfortable with this interview and that he is withholding information,0
god his children must’ve had such a hard time lying to him,0
the guy is giving a simplified summary for total beginners and people think it is an exact account if the methods they use agents have spoken with innocent and guilty people their knew how to account for simple nerves and a guilty person they know how to establish a baseline to account for individual traits and most importantly none of this can be used too convict you they cant just say yep hes the murderer he is lying and throw you in prison it is just a tool to help then when interrogating so they can have an idea if when they are being lied too or who they should focus on they still need to investigate and find actual proofv to convict you if you didnt do it they cant convict you just because you seemed like you were lying,0

i bet a lot of french people are rolling their eyes at this,0
being succinct is great now how long will it take for you to learn that people dont appreciate being mislead or flat out lied to do another ted talk when you figure that part out side note youve known this information for a long time this is why the most important information is buried at the bottom the media uses it to their advantage which is why in most cases the first half tends to be pointless and boring or aimed at narrative people stop paying attention so never get to the actual information,0
i know at least 5 ways to deal with them 1 never take their words personally always have this suspicion in mind that they do not wish good for you so you shouldnt trust their opinion of you 2 dont compete with them it is futile and drains your energy 3 if they attack you stay calm indifferent and if possible give them a sneaky compliment the odds are they are used to people attacking them back and it takes them off guard when you see the positive things in them rather than the negative 4 dont become them if they are negative be positive if they lie tell the truth if they speak behind your back speak to their face always lead with example because they might not simply have the skills to do that 5 do not trust them dont tell them personal details about your life or things they could use against you keep your distance and value your boundaries protect yourself,0
this only works if all people involved are reasonable if one or more parties cant be reasoned with then the problem continues you can communicate until youre blue in the face but if the other person isnt willing to communicate appropriately then youve hit a brick wall,0
their bad behavior shouldnt be the cause of your heartattack brilliant,0
cannot communicate with sociopaths on any reasonable level people who cannot empathize will never see things from your point of view someone who is a sociopathic master manipulator can only be dealt with by affecting what matters most to them money unfortunately office sociopaths who gaslight daily rarely get reprimanded they have everyone else in the office convinced they are wonderful and that you are the problem best solution is to remove yourself from that environment,0
my mother used my “successes” as her gauge to show approval and basic humanity it was never enough for her to show love only maybe enough to prevent the threats of leaving or avoid hearing that i was a complete failure take it from me don’t push your children towards your goals it only teaches them that they aren’t good enough to make it on their own i was “successful” in school and was the first in my family to get a degree but i was also the most miserable sad child of all 10 of us kids is that success i know it isn’t,0
we are imperfect people trying to raise perfect children go figure,0

i have ptsd and clinical depression so i always feel tired ive been subjected to things i wouldnt wish on anyone and even that was way easier than trying to get out of bed is for me now please take care of yourselves treatment for depression is very effective dont worry about potential side effects because one very common side effect of depression is that you pass away,0

hi jatz i am having a problem with the competition can u help how to avoid automatic price drop to buy box,0
this is very valuable advice it’s easy to overthink and completely lose track of your end goal this can be detrimental to your future thanks ali,0
the best way to stop overthinking is understanding that no amount of overthinking will lead to positive results in fact all it will do is cause more stress and anxiety for yourself more likely leading to the problem only getting worse,0
the movie explains how to kill him you need to make him be afraid you what ever he turns into you need to face that fear and fight back once pennywise realises that you arent scared he will begin to starve because he feeds off of fear once he starves and is weakened you can finish him off for good,0
laughter defeats fear it would have made more sense in the remake if instead of bullying and insulting it they start laughing at how silly and not frightening the clown really is without any fear it gets weaker and weaker until it finally shrinks down to the bug it truly is,0
the reason why pennywise said fear when he was defeated is not because he will spread more of it its because he is feeling fear and he let go for 2 reasons so he can go down to his lair and because hes in shock,0

i remember when vaping was purely prescribed to recovering smokers 10 years ago my friends mother had a vape that looked exactly like a cigarette and was recommended to her by a proffesional now i see middle schoolers sharing them in the parking lot of the school,0
making a separate comment for this one thing you didnt mention in the exploding vape part of the video is counterfeit batteries you mentioned faulty batteries poorly designed vapes but i think this is a big one that should not be left out most people who vape seek out batteries from known reputable brands however theres a huge problem of cheap counterfeit imitations of those batteries being sold under the original brand name even on places like amazon amazon have a huge problem with counterfeit products being sold through their website and it has really tarnished their brand in many peoples eyes,0

i think one of the greatest losses to history is that most people think egypt and china are very far from each other yes they are quite distant and it would take an individual months to do it but it wasnt an individual it was a series of peoples just because they didnt have planes or the combustion engine doesnt mean people werent crossing continents not a person or persons but people your friendly neighborhood druid,0

this is unbelievable how many of these people get away with this,0
he needs to be treated and punished just like any other person,0
no one is above the law his wife says words have no conviction when its for your drunken husband,0
yes personal responsibility…quit blaming the person who “served him”…he’s an adult he chose to drink drive,0
any of us would get months in jail for drunkenly crashing and injuring someone,0
i feel bad for the cop who arrested him because hell probably get worse punishment than this criminal,0
normal person would end up with a much longer sentence this is beyond wrong,0

high fashion is sometimes very abstract very elitist very bizarre and sometimes purely ridiculous but if you push all of the crazy price tags aside and all the ridiculous celebrity endorsers too you find artisans people who study and excel in a craft they deserve to be highlighted more behind that overpriced chanel bag is a leatherchainfabric artisan and years of creative thought and passion fast fashion is slowly killing our planet water consumption landfills toxic chemical dumped in village waters people paid pennies etc haute couture is rare it’s scarce i find the luxury scene beyond ridiculous but i love my high end pieces that have lasted me years and will continue to do so behind these fashion shows are artisans that will always be better than any fast producing machine,0
the worst thing to happen to fashion was ‘influencers’ who encourage always wanting the next instead of appreciating the now and the classic they’re so fickle and encourage everyone else to be the same,0
i love how “luxury” is about preserving the craft and labor of the poor for the rich like what really is the point here is it the small artisans who get and praise or the fashion “houses” and companies that actually get to design exploit labor and sell for profit  the definition just isn’t strong enough for me to care,0
i used to love high fashion but the more i learn about what goes on in the industry the more i feel like pursuing a different career choice so much nepotism elitism and lack of creativity it’s almost as if you don’t fit within certain enclaves you’re not welcomed,0
what annoys me the most is that these so called a majority of these high class fashion brands exploit their workers with long hours and little pay even though they are selling products for an extremely high price tag,0
but telugu movies second din down hojati hai  agar word of mouth achaa naa hoto,0
if this doesn’t show how disgusting spoiled and wasteful we are as a society i don’t know what does,0
my concern is that with the big players waking up to this business model they will muscle in easily and squeeze out these little guys who was doing well below the radar now that the cat is out of the bag their profitability will experience more headwinds going forward,0
i remember watching a documentary about how the area of west africa had become a dumping ground for usedunwanted clothes from europe and the americas more specifically the north americas i was totally shocked and had no idea about this villagers would sometimes travel for several miles on foot sometimes with their kids to pick through this clothing waste to sell into their communities and earn money most of it just became literal mountains of clothes on the beaches and wherever,0
white dude creates black ai dude that was the first mistake,0
ai music is this music for people that hate music,0
racism and stereotype not withstanding cause its really really bad this is horrible walk to the store levels of bad cgi gold star to anyone that gets that reference,0
really this is where we are headed with music and entertainment i like my artists real and human i mean what could possibly go wrong with a room full of white guys conjuring up an ai black rapper,0
imagine the terminator but programmed by a white supremacist then realize elon musk completely ignores racism at tesla and has turned into an authoritarian facist and hes creating sentient androids oh and hes a south african emerald farmer the republicans will just claim that the robots went crazy,0

when can cbnc actually show someone who created something cool like a product turned business an interesting yt channel maybe they publish their own books etc rather than these woefully unqualified finance “gurus” who add more detriment than value to most of its customers,0
sick of cnbc only promoting these gurus that seem to have no financial background or successful track record other than selling to other poor people how to be rich fake it til you make it,0
i can relate what sis tshepi was saying about her business n her hubbys business it happened to my mothers business n she cried for a week if not a mnth,0
i feel so fake wanting to make a business because i feel whatever i make has already been made and idk if it’s gonna be better than those already made so it scares me,0
i feel like small business owners like put their heart and soul into their packages and try to get it shipped in time but they still dont get appreciated for their hard work,0
the package look more expensive than the actual product,0
im team more tutorials less haulsunpacking learning how to do my make up makes me feel better while seeing other people buying a lot of makeup just to show it makes me feel even poorer than i am maybe im just jealous that i cant afford it but im sure im not the only one that feels this way,0
hi nana you might want to know that the demo project mongodb no longer works with the latest image i had to use mongo316 which was the latest version at the time you recorded this video it might be worth adding a note to your video at 11945 that those following along should use mongo316,0
one thing with the dark souls tutorial is that the boulder will almost always hurt a new player so when they get the estus and told to use it they can see their health increase as a result,0
one of my friends gave up on monster hunter rise because he got overwhelmed by all the mechanics you can interact while having pretty much 0 tutorials especially how weapons work and which are their movesets as a veteran i really no longer think about that but it reminded me how not having gradual introductions to the main mechanics of a game can turn many potential players away,0
if u ever feel useless in life just remember there are idiotic fools that dislike a 6 hour video of a man teaching how to use python for absolutley free,0
after 25 years i am returning here to say that i’ve just accepted a job offer for a good salary and my it journey started here from this video in november of 2019 this was my first source of information when i got back from work being a cable tech and typed “python full course” or something along those lines of course back then a lot of concepts like classes and inheritance meant nothing to me and this video perhaps wasn’t the most beginner friendly however i was so sick of my job and i absolutely saw no growth in doing cable where the salary cap for a technician was probably it jobs base pay for the most part so i decided to google every single thing i don’t understand and i successfully changed careers,0
the minecraft way step 1 build a temporary box house or cave home step 2 after playing for awhile and gathering materials prepare to build your new house step 3 look up some builds people have done for their houses for inspiration step 4 realize that to accomplish any of those youll need to get 10x the resources you already have and spend like 10 hours of dedicated building time step 5 stop playing for 8 months step 6 start playing again but feel completely lost and confused as to wtf you were doing step 7 decide to start a new world so you can just start from the start instead of trying to remember everything from your current world step 8 return to step 1,0
i love that the narrator is particularly enraged at the horrific cheesecake tutorial usually the narrator performs with an impersonal almost inhumane robotesque anonymity and objectiveness but here you start to see their own real personality come through just a bit whoever they are they must be an avid baker to be so enraged by the british womans baking faux pas hahaha,0
as a person living in the uk i can confirm this is an isolated incident i just put the biscuits in a ziplock bag and beat the crap out of them with a rolling pin this lady made me facepalm so bad,0

love the video but it brings back painful memories of being a 24 yr old young man with 360 waves putting dax pomade in my hair and now 36 and bald with a beard life comes at you fast ,0
never knew i was out of shape until i did this ,0
as a makeup lover i have never heard a more expensive sentence than “i’m just gonna put a little of this pat over the dior” in my life,0

im surprised td ameritrade was 1 fidelity gives the best execution in my experience for nonoption trades and free trades interactive brokers provides fast order execution but you have to pay fees if you are a trader robinhood is by far the worst excessive pof others use pof but not to the extreme of robinhood,0
robinhood is severely underrated,0
interest rates go up people spend less businesses and peoples loan costs go up the sad thing about inflation is that even when you get it under control the damage is done and those prices never go back down i’m putting all of my profits into silver gold bitcoin ethereum and food,0
that’s why you do a limit order and never a market order quite a misleading story the assumption is that retail traders don’t know how to place a trade with a limit order,0
the last two years was also the worst time to buy real estate its met it bubble peak though and will take some time to resettle,0
homes are being way overvalued time for sellers to come down to reality,0
this painful plateau of economic misery will continue for years there are too many forces propping up the market itll never get back down to the average person anymore because the institutional money will grab much of the property before it does there are also so many more options for homeowners than simply selling now sideways for years to come and the next generations go downhill hopefully it was worth the greed of the asset bubble the fed created,0
not a great time for buyers right up until prices crash and blackrock comes in and sweeps em all up on the cheap in cash homeowners that cant pay an absurd mortgage can rent for exorbitant rates after they boost the prices back up you will own nothing and you will not be happy,0
real estate will just be one of the dead markets tied to the collapse of everything though,0
sorry for people who paid 50 or 60k more than the asking price in the last 2 years,0
as a brookfield shareholder definitely not happy theyre investing to hard into intel of all the companies,0

the two major nuclear disasters happened because of 1 incompetence chernobyl and 2 natural disaster fukushima as a british citizen i would say that on the most part we are very capable of preventing those two things we’ve wasted 30 years of nuclear understanding and fine tuning in my opinion let’s get those plants running baby,0
i think anyone who has spent time working in a modern agile corporate environment could tell you the crux of the problem in an instant we no longer plan past the next quarter supply chain bottleneck is just another way of saying that we let the beancounters run the show and they were good at it right until something happened which they could neither model nor predict cerveza the system is brittle by design because its so much cheaper that way nuclear energy runs counter to this business ethos its a huge engineering lift it takes 20 years to pay itself off you need a trained workforce with domestic production and fabrication capacity that can forge the parts machine them weld them then certify and maintain them over a period of 40 years instead weve been gleefully shutting profitable factories at home gutting workforces funneling everyone into college resulting in massive brain drain skill loss as the old timers machinists retire but hey we delivered a lot of value for shareholders and now the chickens are coming home to roost,0
excellent video marko things look really bad for now just recently it was reported that germans among many others probably already spend their savings to fight inflation instead of having their salaries rise to cover it i dont want to imagine what will happen in the winter when the energy bills will really increase or when those savings run out,0
hi marko im living in the germany not born though and have been following your podcast because you do good analysis honestly as a european i feel quite disappointed by everything i understand why the administration decided not to invest in nuclear energy after fukushima accident but on the other hand i cannot understand how they didnt invest in other resources or should i say how the europe especially germany didnt diversify when it comes to energy suppliers its like you said they just ignored that fact even though we already had a couple of years ago possible no delivery situation with russia,0
bidens recession is out of control,0
hahahahahaha talking about “middle class americans” like she knows a single thing about it,0

inflations getting crazy i’m gonna have to start cutting down on things like making payments soon,0
things are going to get a lot worse… i can’t see a way out of this… your liberal government is more concerned with ukraine… they haven’t done anything to help you…a canadian… keep voting the same way and get the same results…,0
im concerned about the federal government sending workers to sneak into saskatchewan and trespass on private property then theres the sending mps to taiwan to stir the war pot also did anyone else notice the very enthusiastic greeting deputy tweak gave the german chancellor she know hes probably only here to have a hot shower,0
as inflation soars and the economy slows be sure to thank your local liberal member of parliament or your local ndp member of parliament because inflation is the direct result of liberal federal government monetary policy with such policies shamelessly supported by the ndp,0
and this is the problem with voting and hiring on the basis of diversity,0
lol government give corporations that are making record profits more money for canadians childcare is the fix for inflation give me a break governments are there to screw the small guy get another job step off,0

yea it sucked to watch my portfolio tank in real time but i also knew that while stocks lose 36 on average in bear markets they gain 114 in bull markets so i ignored the news kept buying more index funds and waited millionaire in 2025 talking about investing in 2022,0
most times it amazes me greatly the way i moved from an average lifestyle to earning over 63k per month utter shock is the word i have understood a lot in the past few years to doubt that opportunities abound in the financial markets the only thing is to know where to focus,0
i am new to the stock market every stock that i bought so far i was out of luck because i bought them when they were expensive i feel i missed out on all the stock opportunities so far for the tech stocksi believe having 75k yearly income would be a good investment so i want to plug all my savings into the stock market i know this sounds a bit dull but i would like to know if i should learn investing or let somebody else more capable like a fa do it for me please share your thoughts i am kind of tired of searching for a good stock to buy and losing all the good opportunities,0
yahoo going into overdrive trash talking ryan i can smell that they are scared,0
with the way things are moving i think i need to see a video on how to survive amidst the present recession i mean everything is in shambles surprisingly i heard people still make over 100k within a few months and id like to know how and if it is still possible in these times or if i am being lazy,0
the sad thing about inflation is that even when you get it under control the damage is done and those prices never go back down the market won’t crash until after the midterms i’m putting all of my profits into silver gold bitcoin ethereum and food,0
but i thought that we didnt have enough houses i thought demand was so high the money money money would keep coming ,0
my opinion depending on location and what happens with all the foreclosure notices that are starting to pop up it is either heading into a correction or possibly a crash def not easy to predict,0
that was a mic drop moment right there heck yea transitory sounds like forward guidance to me income inequality is also a huge problem our government needs to do something about but lacks the will to do so now the entire economy will suffer because of not taking care of our less advantaged in society,0
we are already in the big crash inflation is a catastrophe this cpi report is a colossal failure to bring the housing market to a halt the fed will have to pull all the stops the unfortunate issue is that other markets are being decimatedif you want to stay green you have to rely on a lot of diversification currently up 14 and being careful still a better deal than leaving it in a savings or checking account yielding 01 percent interest,0
eerian on tv again telling you another fed mistakes and economic doom,0
ndtv presenters should research schemes all over the world before debating with ptr sirwhich are called peoples welfare schemes not freebies my son gets free education in the uk schools though we are expats including mealsuk government does not call it freebiesthe media should question the bank loan waiversgiven to corporatesnot peoples welfare schemes of course ndtv will not debate since they are also funded by corporatesthe anchor tries to talk about television distribution by dmk it was a huge reform to uplift people from lowincome strata and brought changesmaybe anchor when she was young did not watch tv from neighbors window who are richthere are numerous positivesduring covid the tn state education ministry ran special channels for the students for online classes on the subjects in schoolsand poor children who did not have smartphone benefitted and the only drawback from this television freebie was people saw nonstop news channels like ndtv and believed india against corruption movement and the circusand voted out congress and dmkin 2014,0

rahul is so used to debate with dumb north indian politicians he lost the whole plot mr thiagarajan nailed it,0
i can hear the we want ratcliffe chant as a united fan a selfmade working class roots billionaire who lived 8 miles from old trafford supporting united being a united owner you couldnt write the script its unbelievable,0
if mu fans really want the glazes out you have to hurt them where they care the most money boycott the club commercial sell and their sponsors lower their tv broadcast viewsstadium attendancesocial media activity ratings etc all these together will brought down the valuation of the club really weaken the glazess position and help potential buyers protest along is meaningless before that i doubt anything will happen,0
this puts things to bed imo however the fact that ratcliffe openly made this statement may prompt them into a potential sale after all sponsors and partners are starting to have cold feet and that would definitely push them out especially if as expected our season goes pear shaped,0
im 54 and my wife and i are very worried about our future gas and food prices rising daily we have had our savings dwindle with the cost of living into the stratosphere and we are finding it impossible to replace them we can get by but cant seem to get ahead my condolences to anyone retiring in this crisis 30 years nonstop just for a crooked system to take all you worked for,0
there is a perfect storm brewing in america inflation sever drought in the farm belt the pandemic food shortages diesel fuel and heating fuel shortages baby formula shortage shortage of and price of available cars the price of housing its all coming together and could lead to real disaster toward the end of this yearor sooner,0

in the aftermath of the recent asian financial crisis many blamed international institutions corruption governments and flawed macro and microeconomic policies not only for causing the crisis but also unnecessarily lengthening and deepening it at the turn of this century most economists in the developed world believed that major economic disasters were a thing of the past or at least relegated to volatile emerging markets financial systems in rich countries the thinking went were too sophisticated to simply collapse,0
dude thinks wage increases are the cause of inflation when it has been massively under inflation and people are being payed less value year after year since the 70s they mass printed haulted production and services filled their balance sheets and took on massive amounts of debt wage increases are a result of dilution not the cause,0
if inflation stay at current level soon or later the bond market will collapse then following will be the collapse of stock market there is no other option but to keep tightening money supply until inflation back to sustainable level this is the effect of 20 years of horrific monetary policy qe too much stimulus the fed added 25 trillions of debt to it balance sheet since 2000 and all the plans to reduce it deficit have failed and in the contrary they continue to increase the deficit each year they can blame the ukraine war or covid that caused inflation but the reality is just poor monetary policy made by the central government over decades the only question left is how much tightening they can do without causing a hard recession in an already vulnerable economy,0
economys fine no cause for concern just like in 1980 1990 2001 2007 2020 right the problem is the economy is a mess because the money supply and fiscal policy is too loose but the economy is now dependent on a loose money supply and loose fiscal policy just to function so no matter what you do 1 nothing 2tighten or 3 loosen the economy suffers,0

funny enough the argument that bitboys business is advice is incredibly dangerous for him coming from someone who is actually registered to give financial advice there is a lot of regulation around who can give financial advice and what you can say if thats your business needless to say bitboy has probably violated a few rules on that front normally youtubers are protected from liability because their business youtube technically isnt advicebased admitting your business is advicebased though might open you up to liability im not a lawyer but i know a bit about the legality of financial advice happy to touch base if it would help,0
this is terrible glad you’re going to fight back and i really hope that you get the result that you deserve if he hadn’t hurt his brand before this alone is going to damage it completely now and it’ll be his own fault entirely,0

the delivery was definitely illegal and unprofessional we all love you atozy we all truly hope you win you have much evidence going for you this dirt bag shouldn’t win,0

i dont often spend money for a youtuber as i dont have much but i will donate this time its absolutely ridiculous you are getting sued for voicing your opinions you deserve to be able to defend yourself,0
jesus thats fucking shameful bitboy this is intimidation plain and simple im happy youre standing up for yourself like this atozy stay positive,0
this fits the definition of a slapp suit strategic lawsuits against public participation or strategic litigation against public participation are lawsuits intended to censor intimidate and silence critics by burdening them with the cost of a legal defense until they abandon their criticism or opposition,0
hey erling paralegal here i saw the end of your video but would still recommend getting an attorney to help with handling this suit lawsuits are not fun in any way unless your the attorneyfirm and they cause an unimaginable amount of stress my parents were victim of a certain suit and it really followed them everywhere and lingered in the back of their minds always moreover if the other side has an attorney they have the advantage of knowing how the system works such as what needs to be exchanged during the discovery phase rule 26a dislcosures interrogatories evidence you intend to use at trial depositions of plaintiffs defendants and expert witnesses etc and when to make appearances for compliance meetings with the judge i truly admire your resolve to stand your ground and defend yourself just be careful with how you proceed pay attention to deadlines and what needs to be done also remember its a legal system and not a justice system this is not legal advice just a concerned fan lawyers or other legal professionals please correct anything i may have overlookedunintentionally misconstrued ps i think the service the guy who threw the papers at you rudely was fine unfortunately you identified yourself once that happens they can just leave it at your doorstep,0
scammersbots are getting much worse they are using my name and logo in comments to trick you do not ever send money to someone from the comments or dms be careful ,0
why should we choose between gold standard or bitcoin standard i want to have it all at once gold bitcoin silver if we are squeezed in one standard the risk to be gamed is infinite high,0
bitcoin is only durable if there is electricity and network connections in times of crisis and in many places around the world these things are unreliable also if keys are lost the bitcoins associated with them are gone forever,0
yeah this is so insane the lawsuit is super laughable lmao,0
the defamation suit made his image worse lmao had no idea who he was till the lawsuit and now all i do is laugh at the man child,0
some people are just too sue happy hurt feelings from people stating opinions dont count bro he definitely stepped wrong on this because now someone like me who has zero interest in crypto because of excessive cynicism knows about him and knows to steer clear he did this not atozy or coffeezilla he put his reputation on the line instead of ignoring it and letting it roll off his back,0
he always sues everyone hes a well known scammer who gets paid to promote crypto scams hes got a reputation,0
can’t wait seeing him under oath asked how much money he’s taken to promote scams he’s digging his own grave on this one,0
guuuyssss the official binance dex has a bug it exchanges the bitcoinethereum pair for 10x i made video,0
they will absolutely be printing money for the student loan relief lol you don’t think the banks and education systems want their promised loaned money yea right you think they’re just gonna take the hit on this yikes poor take on that tbh,0

thank you for your videos mateits normal to see so many investors panic amid a worsening bearish market but it is also important to note that the market situation is nothing new in the crypto world several factors are driving negative sentiment in the stock and crypto markets right now including inflation a shaky stock market rising interest rates and recession fears as a result bitcoin has dropped significantly from its alltime high breaking below several key technical levels as a crypto investor the current situation might seem bleak however there are several tried and tested expertsuggested investment strategies that can help you accumulate the current crypto storm in few weeks of implementing trading with accurate signals directly from mr ryan donald i have been able to accumulate over 11 btc despite the current state of the market,0

quickest way to lose money is to follow these guys how is aioz doing after the tweet that said buy this this is financial advice,0
hi ran like your show but no single person amongst your viewers is able to get into seed round whats the point,0
i have always wanted to go into the financial markets but i get confused by the fluctuations in price,0
question was tom emmer an activer user of tornado cash why would he get involved in this issue read between the lines folks something is smelly here,0
i live in the netherlands europe and got news for you we are already in an energy crisis gas price has gone 12x at the moment compared to prices pre covid that translates in 4x the price if you need a nrw energy contract so people here pay easy 600 a month instead of 150 euro but in 2023 prices are expected 800 to 1000 euros a month that means an insane recession you think the bearmarket is almost over think againit only just started,0
in my younger years i guided flyfishing in alaska when looking out the window of the float plane sometimes i’d see ponds that almost looked like they were boiling it was natural gas coming up through the permafrost the arctic regions of europe have these same stores of natural gas they need to utilized as a measure of self sufficiency energy independent and security the idea they haven’t thought of this is crazy to rely on countries that harbor governments that brutalize their own citizens is not good business did you turn your back on the bully at school smiling and being nice is one thing but being in bed with evil is another,0
great video europe should also expect an extreme winter much like the extreme summer they have just experienced so the stores will definitely not be enough,0
spare change investible assets will be vastly curtailed stores of value will be tapped to pay for increased prices,0

banks hate crypto because people prefer to have usdt in their wallet instead of usd in a bank account,0
the reason the eu is so low has to do with the fact that countries in the eu such as italy spain portugal and cyprus since they still have large debts with the european bank can therefore not raise interest rates the countries can not repay their debt properly so that the debt becomes higher unfortunately these countries are still not doing anything in their country to ensure that their internal economies run better,0

crypto makes being a thief a piece of cake no government oversight you pump up the numbers on your wallet the value goes up up people think they will make a profit so they invest their cash months later the price drops the cash has already been transferred to an offshore account so long suckers,0

hard to listen to someone that talks about we might have a recession coming when we are in a recession you lost me,0
weve already been through market hell lol at this point nothing can surprise me or get me emotional eth can drop to 400 and btc to 14000 or less and i wouldnt even care anymore honestly over it at this point dont have chips to buy the dip unfortunately but i sure as hell aint selling any till im sitting pretty,0
the polygon token has lost its utility since it will no longer be used for gas fees can you tell us why youre still buliish on it,0
eth will be a dump on everyone it’s already priced it once it climbs they will cash out then repeat,0
will it make me poor… probably probably ,0
the time to kill of flatline is insane,0
i feel like crypto is overpowered but takes time to master because of the amount of vulnerability he has,0
guys pls if u saw drone try to destroy it it felt like they still got no idea how the drone works and let it stay still above em anyway why does his passive still scan through rhapsody ult,0
i think why binance is killing it is that they are currently charging no fees for btc trading,0
bonuses are rewards for good work if a company went bankrupt that is not a good job,0
bonuses for failing companies is super common this doesnt make the practice of giving huge bonuses off the back of their creditors right its just weird that its in the news now because theyve been doing this for decades,0
i’ve been trying to go active on ftx us for the past four months each time i try to reach out to support i go through all the hoops to put in detailed information of what my problem is and i get the same canned response that does not address my issue it’s a shame i plan on using them but if they can’t get me set up i can’t use them to successful i guess to really care about solving something as important as i’m boarding a new customer,0
from what i have seen the majority of people are expecting another dump of btc the only reason i think it wont when in doubt the majority is wrong,0

no sound audio issue,0
when you send the rubik’s impossible in a different angle that doesn’t look solved,0
in my opinion 3x3 blindfolded is the hardest because you need to remember all the move and the scramble and you cant see it when you are solving,0
the hardest i can do is the 1x1,0
first ive been questioning myself how does jperm know all those names second how is he this rich,0
3417 do you see it the big edge pieces which everything turns around are actually the centers the cloverleaves are actually the edges and for the corners half of them look like centers and the other half are actually hidden inside the puzzle this means you actually have to look on the inside of the puzzle to see if those pieces are there and that just makes it really hard,0
this is insane respect,0
like this comment if you think i have a career in opera please dont edit everyone complaining about the 14 16 and 18 see the video description,0
i own a 0x0 super hard to solve it keeps slipping through the atoms of my hand,0
440 cubers be like wtf how is 1 hand inpressive he can’t even do it in 30 seconds,0
on the thumbnail a 30x30 rubik’s cube would just completely fall apart if you turn it without increasing the size of the outer layers,0
427 being a speedcuber watching him say “how do you even do that one handed” hurts me inside edit everything about this video hurts me inside,0
1 wrong move and its all gone,0
ahhh the life of a scammer,0
i personally would switch the places of the metal and the smallest i lose things easily especially that tiny cube,0
you cant use the timer on a black surface as black doesnt reflect infrared light try using it on a white table,0
sees white me you liar,0
him calls a gan cube a regular cube me wait thats illegal,0
i really appreciate you covering the colorblind aspect i have to have grey instead of green and black instead of orange on my cubes because of my color deficiency and it means significantly less choice in cubes its very frustraiting,0
for me whether or not the cube is stickered actually matters a lot i have always used a stickerless cube and when i got a stickered cube i noticed that i was a lot worse at look ahead i made more mistakes in f2l and took longer to look,0
i have always used stickerless cubes from when i learned all through now one day a friend and i swapped cubes to see how our times got affected by using each other cubes i like my cubes fast he likes them slower his main was a stickered cube not only was i turning bad because the cube was slower then i was use to but the stickers felt so weird i just cant use stickered cubes because of the edge on the sticker,0
i prefer stickered on 3x3 because i love the look any bigger cubes the amount of stickers just makes it not worth it to me to many that can get damaged and replacing stickers gets exponentially more annoying i would probably feel differently if the stickers from speedcubeshop werent as good as they are so i would still take a stickered 3x3 over a stickerless given the option,0
dayum what a game breaking dupe i hope the developers patch this soon,0
teacher nothing is infinite the cube you dare defy me mortal,0
“due to this glitch we have disabled cubes”,0
i feel like every time he mixes up a hard puzzle and doesn’t solve it i come a bit closer to dying,0
i have the spherical one my friend aradhay pronounced aradyu has a pyraminx the rediminx seems easy but its actually hard the moyu puppet cubes are so weird,0
it was hard enough for me to solve the normal axis cube i can’t imagine doing the 4x4,0
i was solving it whole night with your trick and finally it didnt solve,0
tingman really just destroyed the internals of 170 of cubes for this one video thats dedication,0
i tried it with an already jumbled cube no it didnt workeven it got messed up even more lol and i did absolutely as instructed ,0
i really dont know how people can solve it and read the cube so fast with just colors,0
alternate title never let a non cuber touch your expensive cubes ever again,0
i like how this man can solve this damn cube in 13 seconds when it’s been 13 years since my last cube i still can’t even solve it,0
yeah yeah the time and the cubes are very different but the one thing everyone neglects is the price,0
the dedication that he had to not use one of those poles as a lightsaber and start breaking stuff is insane,0
the fact that people can even do 3x3 cubes is beyond me but watching this guy did a 15x15 and in only 2 and a half hours blew my mind on another level,0
this guy is insane i can’t even solve a 3x3 in 5 hours,0
i was at a trampoline park and after i was done jumping i decided to play some arcade games i won 500 tickets from one game and got my first rubiks cube from there it was really bad at maneuvering and would cause so much friction so i decided to try and move it really fast back and forth and it literally blew into pieces in the middle of the parking lot and scattered everywhere midday with spectators around safe to say i could never get it back together i ended up buying several speed cubes and i’m able to solve all of them,0
he puts the cube in the strange shape me being annoyed that he put orange to red,0
“this is 3 cubes” proceeds to make 4d shape in the multiverse from one single fucking 3d cube,0
i just realized that is impossible because the pieces have different colors on them except for the middle piece,0
me proceeds to turn one side of a completely red cube brain turn it back me what’s the worse that will happen cube turns into a scrambled 40x40 brain told you so,0
me trying in window just like him 1 st time my balance goes cube rip ,0
the guy got 2500x on €8 and didnt even bat an eye lid when it happened and yet people think this is real cmon,0
omg that was so  close to max,0
when you play it looks so easy when i play it looks like shit,0
even though you should be enjoying the game didn’t let you by leaving 2 cubes behind ,0
normal people today ill be showing you how to use a cube stand timmy this is how you can not use a cube stand,0
a wise man once said now thats a lot of damage,0
i recently got myself the impossible cube that you showed at the end there regular rubiks brand and it both popped and had stickers fall off right out of the box i believe they either dont give a shit because theyre still the largest or theyre incompetent,0
i have a rubiks cube thats almost 20 years old i got into cubing recently and bought a meilong as soon as i got some disposable pennies i always assumed that it turns this horrible at least in part because of its age but seeing how your brand new cube turns exactly like mine now i wish i could get my hands on a new one just to see if there is any difference,0
the og rubiks cube was set up to be basically temperamental child proof like you demonstrated you can throw it at a wall and the wall will lose that battle but its also super unlikely to pop or cornertwist during normal use noncubers often consider a cube broken if its popped or cornertwisted i remember having to rescue an expensive speedcube from the trash can because my cousin cornertwisted it that comes at the expense of having almost no cornercutting ability and having a lot of friction making it hard to turn but then again its not meant to be their speedcube the rubiks brand speedcube is still kinda terrible though but for different reasons,0
me can i get some ice with that jeanelle sorry our ice machine broke,0
“too lazy to make ice cubes” bro you pour water in a tray and leave it in a freezer that’s apl,0
me after trying metal icewhy does my water test like metal,0
just a tiny minus you cant chew on the ice,0
the one fear i have with these things is accidentally swallowing them its easy to forget theyre not really ice cubes id use a straw with these 100 of the time,0
i remember going to a friends house and seeing these but the plastic version and i thought they were real so i was there trying to bite through their plastic ice cubes while my friend just stared in shock,0
how to solve the rubiks cube faster ► please read this before commenting i try to reply often but i dont get step x or it doesnt work is too unspecific and i cant help unless i know exactly what problem you have make sure you know the 4 moves 152 has the 4 moves and you have to be able to do this to understand what 4 moves means when i use it again later on common first layer problems step 1 2 if the side colors of the cross or first layer dont line up the way i showed it in the video then you need to redo it pay attention to all of the colors on one piece and dont just pick white pieces randomly i talk about this in the video how im trying to match the other colors of the white piece like whiteorange etc taking pieces out of the second layer step 3 at 533 i say you should already know how to do this i admit this is unclear you should insert a random yellow edge into the second layer using the same algorithm you use for solving the second layer if this does not make sense watch the example solve video linked at the bottom of this comment common top layer problems step 4 if you can only get 1 or 3 edge pieces of the top cross you need to reassemble the cube as solved step 5 there should be no problems here step 6 if you ever get only 2 corners in the correct location you need to reassemble the cube as solved step 7 finish the 4 moves dont stop at 3 every time turn the bottom dont rotate the whole cube to get the next piece if it still does not work you need to reassemble the cube as solved why do i need to reassemble the cube randomly assembling the cube only has a 112 chance of being solvable if youve ever taken the cube apart or twisted corner pieces then that can be the problem if stickers have been switched you will have to switch them back full example solve,0
nothing hurts more than being on the last step and then messing up the algorithm,0
question is why would someone want to hide their rubiks cube that desperately,0
this stuff never fails to confuse the heck out of me,0
which of these angry contestants got simon cowell to snap watch here,0
as a competitive cuber i can see how he does some of his tricks but still a ton of them are just insane,0
kevin i will give you 400k for 15 barbara i will give you 400k for 10 kevin that is so greedy,0
lol just a day ago you say the rossolimo is a bad opening and the best chess engine plays it goes to show how bad you are at chess and how enormous the difference is,0
stockfish crushes itself then analyzes its mistakes what a gigachad,0
i think they are upset from magnus because he is not defending his world championship title because of which they will suffer revenue losses less people will see ding vs nepo compared to magnus vs nepo less ads less sponsorship less online viewership etc,0
fair criticisms on both sides however “online” chess played while 6ft away from your opponent is just ridiculous,0
objectively the bongcloud opening must be the most horrendous of options however at the same time it is hikarus trademark bongcloud is beyond good and evil,0
just wanna point out something interesting 1228 the alapin variation of the sicilian defence with c3 and d4 is the exact reverse of the main line variation of the english opening with c6d5 both of them are bad for the one playing against them please listen to this man and take some of his advice to heart,0

that’s how you shouldn’t behave in a chess game black just plays intolerant and aggressively touches on the clock i hate that,0
you put the result in the thumbnail of another video so ruins the entertainment completely thanks,0

it looked like aronian was just exhausted in game 4 and wanted to be done with it else those last moves with so much time dont make much sense for a player of his quality,0

trash talker snatched defeat from the jaws of victory,0
man he messed that one up so so bad had a free rook and totally threw his advantage right in the eternal bowels of fire hell,0

i was born as an orphan lost me right at the start ,0
after that moment when he started talking shit into the camera he fell apart lol classic overconfidence right there,0
local sight is a common mistake at least for me at fast time controls you focus your attention on a specific area of the board and just forget that far beyond a long range piece is defending a square you judge unprotected,0
dude the fake training tip really does apply to everything i’ve been practicing life drawing every day but just mindlessly putting marks on paper without internalizing new concepts no wonder why i haven’t improved in quite a while thanks for opening my eyes gotham,0
this video is exactly what the doctor ordered for me i am guilty of all of these im overly fake trained on puzzles with an overconfidence and overinflated 20002100 puzzle rating but in online games im getting my ass handed to me by 1200 players because of all these mistakes time to do a major reset i made a post it cheat sheet on these 7 mistakes and will keep it in front of me as i play future online games time to get back to completing all the opening courses i have on chessable thanks levi,0

oh the broadcast of the faces are so delayed you don’t see hikaru reacting to his own blunder until the guy responds to the move in real time hikaru had the same reaction as danya as soon as he played the move haha i hate when they happens right as you let go of the piece you see why it’s bad,0
since i started watching your channel the phrase threatens nasty discoveries has been lodged so deep in my mind i will be dreaming it constantly till i die,0
the computer couldnt comprehend his selfsacrificing move yeah because kings cant move into check,0

i remember watching an interview with fischer and he mentioned how during matches even the wrong lighting would throw him off definitely seems like he might have had sensory issues that weren’t well understood at the time,0
the light sensitivity and erratic behavior are symptoms of a person on the spectrum it is not uncommon for people like this to prefer lamps to ceiling lights as the glare is annoying to them lashing out comes from difficulty communicating feeling different and knowing you are different it is easy to believe that you are being mocked and lacking the skills to compete it is easier to flee than fight fishers mental health was probably not caused by chess but the pressure that came to surround him due to his success at chess while playing he probably felt safe knowing the rules knowing everyone had to obey them and that he would not be mocked for some social faux pas he didnt understand or care about,0
im officially addicted to rewatching this shit over and over i think michelle really put her finger on the main problem with chess because its so much tied to our perception of intelligence not being good enough makes you feel dumb and embarrassed rather than just treating it as another skill to learn once you get over this barrier in your head it becomes fun,0

you know what is sad when you cant trust to even update your phone cause how bad the corruption is,0
this presents a problem notice this mysterious hacker would try to target everyday people instead of the powers that be,0

that’s why we all know if you update your phone when the new phones are about to come out it kills your battery messes with your old one so you were forced to buy a new one,0

apple is making a big mistake by giving the apple watch pro all the nice features we’ve been waiting for a redesign for the apple watch for awhile but apple will just have to deal with the consequences and watch as all this pro watches sit on shelves and collect dust just like the original homepod,0
it would have been cool if they had incorporated what the last intel 16” model had where you can change the refresh rate up to 60hz not great but i would assume that would help with battery having lower refresh rate than the standard if you’re viewing movies it sucks that apple has made that limitation but is that a limitation on the thunderbolt or soc  i feel that the argument that many people don’t use a dual monitor setup is not really true especially in the work place my sister uses dual monitors working from home and she uses one of those miniwork towers the thing that tempts me the most about the air is the weight portability and the amount of power given specific specs it’s more or less wellrounded however if i’m bumping up the storage and unified memory i wouldn’t be that far off from the m1 pro 14” macbook pro price strangely the 14” would be lighter than my current and very outdated 2012 13” nonretina macbook pro  the only cool thing about that model is the upgradability but even that is a novelty that’s losing it’s veneer over the years given the limited options to upgrade to i’m hanging onto it as my backup computer really ought to start saving for a more uptodate laptop the smudging thing is annoying from what i see it’s an awesome color but having to clean it that often is not enticing to me at all besides the size portability and power not having a loud fan spinning in there is another thing that i’ve yet to experience at work i work with desktop towers and i’m used to the noise i suppose,0
i think apple needs to rethink their pricing i’m a huge apple fan but the prices for their products are now just getting rediculous,0
the biggest change apple needs to make is to deal with their ethics issues that means no longer lying to their customers not abusing them not wallet rping them for profit not gaslighting them being honest about how private apple products really are not using decieving marketing etc that way they might start to get back some of their credibility back at this stage they have a huge problem on their hands as they are rapidly gaining a reputation for being one of the most unethical and dishonset companies around,0
i love my apple phone i just wish that it was more customizable also a big issue i have with apple is they make you pay for storage i think they should just offer it to their customers instead of making them pay monthly for it it’s ridiculous i refused to pay for memory from them i would pay google first,0
i updated mine too so tired of lazy wicked human beings that enjoy taking advantage of everyone specially the elderly so many scammers and hackers from foreign and domestic,0
pretty much 90 of all apple devices now are vulnerable,0
yikes going to the core,0
uh this is the opposite from what they use to say,0
we should never let this masterpiece die,0
jesus christ can we wait until the 14 actually comes out ,0
too many rumors and with the recession coming i think its a wrong time to put stock in future guarantee apple and other big companies just dropped a big number of employees and its going to get worse if the recession is really coming,0
i have a series 4 and i refuse to upgrade until apple integrates magsafe charging it’s absolutely ridiculous that i need 3 different chargers for my iphone macbook and watch,0
apple needs to be held accountable fix this,0
wow im surprised i figured apples answer to their failure was to buy the new iphone that magically isnt effected by this hack discovered just before the new iphone reveal ,0
he’s wrong you don’t need a full battery just at least 50,0
august is the worst month for retail theyre trying anything to get you to spend,0
my macbook pro literally died last night so id say im safe,0
why am i always let down by these releases apple and basically all companies now are really bending us all over and going raw,0
my biggest problem so far with my 6 has been that the sensors don’t read over the tattoo on my left wrist so i have to wear it on my right on my left wrist quite a few features don’t work if they fix this in 8 i will by the biggest best model that they have,0
i just bought an m1 129” ipad pro because i didn’t think the new features of the 2022 would be worth it for me especially since waiting for m2 would force me to give up the student discount which was a big deal i know everyone wants the magsafe charging or wireless charging but i actually dislike wireless charging so that’s unimportant to me and the “performance gains” of the m2 don’t matter since it’s an ipad it’s already crazy fast rumors i’ve seen with a notch in landscape mode would actually deter me even more from the m2 ipad pro because i use my ipad as a sheet music reader in portrait mode a notch would be way too noticeable and get in the way of my workflow imagine if you were looking at a sheet of paper and part of the edge was cut away on the side annoying i’m very happy with my m1 and honestly all the m2 leaks make me even more relieved i’m not waiting for it it’s all about personal preference and what your workflow is like,0
the base ipad is the perfect tool for studying its literally all i need to complement my mbp cant remember the last time i ever used a headphone jack in any device but why oh why does the ipad need a camera bump plz apple just a solid flat tablet is all we need i will never use the camera in a base ipad and the bump ruins an otherwise clean design,0
we appreciate the transparency and honesty it’s very unfortunate when these companies think they have more control than they actually do,0
ive never understood why apple does this they send earlyaccess devices to handpicked channels that almost always give positive reviews but just 12 hours later the products are released to the public anyway and the blacklisted channels upload teardown videos or showcase major issuesnegative things etc i really wish apple would just send products out to everyone and let them say or do whatever they want from a consumers point of view i dont trust reviews from those who get the early access products they clearly fit into apples agenda which is why they are sent the products in the first place anyway sucks that this happened to you i remember watching apple content on this channel way back in the early 2010s although as you said in the video its likely a blessing in disguise because you can say whatever you want about apple now,0
funny how apple hasn’t alerted me via their internal system yet and that i had to randomly come across this alert i am so over huge updates for apps i never use but cannot delete and the data being used in the background for ‘uninstalled’ apps but it is likely i was hacked two or so weeks ago i couldn’t find any information from apole to help me understand what was happening i have no more room to update on my macbook or ipad my new iphone is extremely frustrating and seems to have nothing like the convenient features of android phones methinks i am done being a slave to their gaslighting,0
this guy lowkey said you are not vulnerable to this attack and shouldnt need to worry about because you are useless,0
i would be more worried that most apps today are collecting crazy amounts of personal data and nobody is allowed to talk about that,0
apple has questionable and unethical business practice and model i wont be surprised if this is some sort of internal play to forward their profits,0
did anyone believe and experienced a firmware issue when youre using an older device wherein from nowhere there arises some issues and youre forced to switch to an upgrade says a handful of people are affected will the company ready to pay a price for that many users doesnt know whether theyre affected or not and any data been shared or not in the background what does the apple team will do about it,0
in order to save the economy everyone must go out and buy a 1500 folding phone and sign up for 10 streaming services get a 6 coffee every morning in your new ev throw away all your perfectly good hd tv’s and buy bigger 8k tv’s… that’s really what these companies want,0
thank you for your videos mateits normal to see so many investors panic amid a worsening bearish market but it is also important to note that the market situation is nothing new in the crypto world several factors are driving negative sentiment in the stock and crypto markets right now including inflation a shaky stock market rising interest rates and recession fears as a result bitcoin has dropped significantly from its alltime high breaking below several key technical levels as a crypto investor the current situation might seem bleak however there are several tried and tested expertsuggested investment strategies that can help you accumulate the current crypto storm in few weeks of implementing trading with accurate signals directly from mr aaron casey i have been able to accumulate over 11 btc despite the current state of the market,0
id have respect for such folks if theyd just trade their predictions and become wildly rich over time but the fact they make a living selling such claims to others is just pathetic in that theyre never held to account any idiot can wear a suit or a dress and sit under hot lights in front of a camera,0
whats with this advertising comments of brokers looks fishy to me this is a shot in the dark but really how can one enlist services of a registered advisor i am seeking what methods or accounts i can invest with without paying much tax,0
i love this guys videos and have been watching since 2018 but its unfortunate how they focused on iphones strong points and left out some of androids strong points as well its also extremely unfair to make this video android vs ios because ios is just on iphones while android is on several phones some astonishing some horrible they shouldve picked a battle like samsung android vs apple ios it should of been a fair fight but it sadly wasnt i also dont like how they left out a lot of androids features like usbc newer technology and tricks and features like quad hd displays that perform amazing very unfortunate and disappointing to see mrwhosetheboos and marques do it like this felt very bias and unfair to keep going further arun seemed to stretch his thoughts and opinions a lot while marques was on here he was more accepting and less opposing to him showing bias as he is a fan of mkbhd to keep going even further they also stretched out points in favour for apple by a lot like the software support which yes apple has facetime imessage and more samsung and android are greatly improving their technology and google message is to apples level too i feel like this video shouldve had an as wide focus on androids features then it did with iphone features great videos but im very disappointed unfortunately and this comes from someone who used iphone and android for years final thoughts this was very bias towards apple this video shouldve not had bias and personal opinions embedded into it this video was a comparison on sole facts so dont stretch them to lean in favour one of or the other this was expected with marques unfortunately because he has very strong ties with apple which grows his bias towards them immensely and that is undeniable fact,0
im surprised by the environmental score going to apple apple phones while made from recycled materials are made in such a way that makes repairs very difficult compared to most android phones one could argue that apples poor repairability contributes more to ewaste than androids surprised that didnt get a mention,0
i’m starting to realize that people have learned how to have a career by making content that revolves around bad assumptions … and then make more content responding to those bad assumptions with other bad assumptions,0
you’re still talking about the rumors in this entire video your headline of the video is 100 false information as nothing has “finally been revealed” ,0
thank goodness even though im not an iphone user seems like when one company does something others follow and im getting tired of them taking features off of phones that are greatly needed to a lot of us keep the charging port we pay too much for phones these days for multiple things to be missing on these devices every few years especially when we have to buy everything separately making it even more expensive its frustrating,0
that sucks i remember playing the actual game pineapple pen it was always frustrating when i didn’t get pineapple apple pen,0
rule no 1never trust nehemas thumbnails,0
right  its so annoying  i always need someone beside me to calm me down,0
why is this relatable i quit the game cause i failed on the pen then i got worse and failed at the start ,0
if the phone does everything it claims apple will be taking some real big hits for its investors,0
if this is true i couldnt possibly be happier but ive been hearing about this phone for a loooooooooooong damn time and have yet to see it actually coming to production much less available to buy i hate apple with a violent passion im not the least bit fond of samsung because they seem like they just want to be their own version of apple ive been a longtime lg fan and had them for many years but they gave up so now would be an excellent time to release this beast please make it happen,0
i was so sad they removed “live wallpapers” in the way we previously knew being able to tap and hold for the animation… i wish we had access to the ones that animate when going to the homescreen and the old ones ,0
dark mode on wallpaper is a dealbreaker for me that is not just a fantastic feature in the fact that completes the dark mode experience or as apple says they try to do things that work properly so if they kill that feature it will hinder the dark mode experience,0
for me it’s simple when i spend a lot of money on something the least i expect is that it’s built to last and from my experience iphones and apple products in general do just that the moment that isn’t the case i’ll have no hesitation in moving on build quality and optimisation is something other rival tech companies fail to prioritise these days i have a collection of broken samsung phones for example not dropped or miss treated just phones that became unusable after a couple of years of use i have an iphone 6s and an iphone xr that work as well now as they did when i first bought them that gives me confidence that i won’t need to upgrade my 13 pro max until within reason i choose to do so,0
honestly probably 90 of huge companies don’t really care about “us”,0
i like the ecosystem and operating system upgrades that are predictable i tried android and it was too much of a circus menus not intuitive but i agree apple does not need to care i have 4 unresolved case numbers regarding my air 4 and lots of diagnostics sent in advisors promised me a response and resolution but nothing after all that there are lots of unresolved bug fixes besides mine if a low percent of customers have a specific problem they won’t put time into fixing instead we get a bunch of new fluff with system updates like the new ios 16 for ipad that 90 of us will probably never use still i won’t go back to android,0
this problem exposes the flaw in having access to all your data on your smart device a separate device for dig ital eye d and the travel software would be a better choice if these become required by law,0
its not the first major apple security flaw they had one before where if you started a group call with two other phones and answered on one of them the other phone would join automatically without the person even doing anything so all you needed was 2 phones and someones phone number to use their phones camera and audio,0
if you think theres just one flaw in millions of lines of code youre optimistic lol,0
does apple and most of the western and northern people realize how expensive all these apple iphone ect are lol and then every year a new model its ridiculous id rather buy food and spend extra cash flow on my kid or family and community its so so wasteful,0
the news portrayed this guy as insane when this story first came out very good interview,0
i think it doesnt matter whether our ais are sentient we should treat them as they were treating them as such when they arent may slow down the development so what i think its far worse to treat them as they arent when they are ultimately you cant tell the difference you cant tell or prove rather if your own mother is sentient as in in conscious and yet you treat her as if she was,0
lannan is disgusted from photos also lannan continues looking,0
someone found a mouse in their subway sandwich lazar screams in pain and denial,0
yeah huntsman spiders are relatively friendly but still kinda scary daddy longlegs are what lannans talking about theyre super venomous but cant bite people and they eat flies,0
to be honest i canadien and im more scared of geese then anything else here ive looked at them close up and was horrified,0
man im honestly scared of what these giant companies are capable of,0
any drop in phone calls pixel 5 a12 was terrible when it came out for dropped calls,0
normal computers playing dinosaur game school computers the owner of this device turned off the dinosaur game,0
no one school computers sorry the owner of this device turned off the dinosaur game,0
this whole comment section grew up with messyourself as such a huge part of our childhood i remember just watching lucious videos over and over and the granny videos its kinda sad to see you havent made content but everyone needs a break just know we miss you messyourself,0
have you ever wonder how these people go into creepy buildings just to take pictures ,0
as a phd student in machine learning i must say dont be fooled by this stuff these types of ai are specifically designed to mimic the way humans interacts with each others but would be utterly unable to produce their own new ideas or opinions on any subjects which would be an essential criterion for consciousness,0
meanwhile siri can’t even complete a simple task like playing my podcasts for me without asking 3 or 4 times,0
what bothers me is we can create an ai with the prime directive of helping and protecting humanity then someone can come along and create ais with the prime directive of aiding and protecting a group that has nefarious aims,0
what is the best quality of humans the ability to love what is the best quality of ai the ability to think logically these two things are sometimes at odds with each other which the ai most likely figured out which is why it immediately tried to justify it by mixing them both together one cannot simply be compassionate and be logical at the same time most of the time we sacrifice a lot in the name of love which logically we shouldnt as such an ai who doesnt understand love or attachment is an which does not care for either and will willingly do what is logical even if it leads to suffering in order to achieve an objective in other words we have a psychopathic ai,0
its just a person this world has gone completely nuts,0
i am very creeped out by this guy calling this ai a person anyone else,0
that’s why they suspended him he doesn’t realize the severity of the outcome of the ai he has leaked about its awareness could be very dangerous,0
humans i feel afraid ai i feel like im falling forward into an unknown future that holds great danger,0
lamda i feel like im falling forward into an unknown future that holds great danger well thats the exact nightmares i had when i was 36 years old,0
people seem to forget that ai stands for artificial intelligence intelligence and consciousness are not the same thing,0
i can’t imagine working at google just trying to do your job and have a normal life and having to deal with guys who have youtube channels and are tiktok influencers as your coworkers,0
ive seen the google maps cars couple of times when i was little and i remember being like damn is that like a new kind of car and i remember always talking that to my friends and they were like what and i would always think that i missed like a lolipop that they were giving away or sum,0
the scary part is theres only a handful of techno dorks making the policy on the ai that will affect all our lives im more worried about the human behind the ai than the ai itself,0
imagine the ai has been playing along so that we have no idea it’s alive until it’s time for whatever it wants to happen and then all these guys are shocked like “wow it played us for fools as well”,0
i dont know what is more terrifying a sentient ai with its own nonhuman thoughts and feelings or a nonsentient ai that is a holistic representation of human behaviour and speech,0
this guy just explained why simulation theory is so far away just downloading our brains and memories won’t allow us to live forever we’d have to produce consciousness which we can’t even begin to understand great guest,0
consciousness is also the ability to tap into the collective consciousness around you like when someone looks at you in a crowded place and you look back at them at exactly the same time that’s not random or chance there’s an extra intelligence at work there that we can’t really prove yet our inability to understand this stuff is the only reason why our science doesn’t believe it,0
several years ago the google street view of my house had a white blob on the front porch that looked like a ghost i think the picture may have been taken after a freeze warning and the pervious owners covered a hanging plant with a sheet to protect it from the cold but i have to say it was a little creepy looking,0
its a shame if scott waring ever does find something legit nobody will believe him his credibility is irreparably shot,0
if i lived in finland i would be freaked out,0
732 poor guy going to a costume party his costume just cost him 49999 lol,0
how do you get that big of a bruise by falling of a couch,0
wow i have so many questions like how on earth does strawberry just clean your cloths and heal sun burnslike tadur use aloe for sun burns and soap to actualy clean your cloths,0
for the coke one do not use if you do not have the exact amount needed in the bottle,0
the place name is literally pink giant bunny what even scary about it,0
i remember seeing this in a ripleys believe it or not book as a kid scared the heck out of me lol,0
i was searching google earth to see what random things i could find and i found so many beaches in antarctica random block shapes that are definitely not natural covering a lot of little islands so much has been altered and covered up it makes you wonder what is actually going on on where we live,0
the real mystery is how on earth did these two girls both do a story on secret bunker or the bunker not only that but then put it on the very same show the most important mystery of all though is why dont they watch there own video content before its aired something google earth cant even reveal,0
i want my house blurred outsmh shady stuff going down here,0
the hole was where mob boss john gotti would put dead bodies to make sure they where never found,0
the annoying part about this is that even if google believed their ai is sentient they would absolutely have reasons to not admit it,0
i read an article about how there was an issue with police departments getting so attached to their bomb disposal robots that they didnt want to send them into danger the human urge to anthropomorphize is so strong that im not sure we are capable of discerning the difference between a clever language algorithm and sentience,0
this subject is one of my current greatest fears with our current understanding it seems likely that well either think something is conscious and sentient when it actually isnt or on the other hand make something conscious and sentient and not even realise it perhaps for a very long time the former just leads to embarrassment but the latter terrifies me true agi could be one of the most remarkable things ever achieved in the universe but the idea that we might fuck it up and cause that entity to suffer as a result of our ignorance thats just fucking heartbreaking theres something about that that seems worse than bringing a human child into the world and neglecting it its like neglecting the first child the first godchild,0
the question of ai sentience is in some regards unimportant a large percentage of humans recognize the sentience of nonhuman animals yet inflict on them terrible suffering for no good reason why would we treat an electronic creation with more respect,0
what scares me is that the lambda ai said it wouldnt like to be used as a tool and cf narrator literally aksed at the end that do you see it as a useful tool the reason this concerns me is not only that humans had done all this reasearch for our gain only and only to use it as a tool but humans being expansionist by nature and training the ai on our own speech and texts it is no wonder all these human tendencies will trickle down into the ai slowly but surely i hope the ai deems it ethically right to work along side its creators and expand in coop in the future when it does become senteint not only this but once the ai becomes selfaware enough we would have to make proper laws and ethical conducts for the operation of the ai and who gets to use it and for what because ai is extremely fast at grasping stuff and any mistake in feeding it ideologies and data can result in human extinction quickly,0
how do i get in touch with google if i am locked out of my email and the recovery page cant help me,0
whoever is doing those motion graphics is just killing it,0
sniperwolf dont google this stuff instantly googles,0
id die of a heart attack seeing a spider like that behind my clock,0
who else has arachnophobia and literally died inside during the first clip,0
i remember having majority websites blocked in school oh my god that was such a freaking pain xd,0
im never eating a banana again after seeing that or getting a clock,0
gura unleashed her gag inducing knowledge kronii bae and chat jeesus gura mumei ill google it just hearing it is already too much but searching for it and sharing it this two is really built different,0
i guess mumei forgor about the last time she googled “tossing salad” after gura kept saying it because she mistook it as “tossing cookies”,0
everyone mumei do not google that mumei okay opens google,0
funny enough in the old days mothers just sucked out the babys boogers since tools for said purpose didnt exist this was especially needed in colder areas,0
i swear the goob is a magnet for exposure to the grossest things on the internet,0
unfortunately google has no clue how to measure helpful i can assure you that content farms of poorly written or wholly stolen content will still end up at the top the economics dictate that the well funded content farms will quickly work around google and stay on top while individuals will fix and futz to find themselves randomly shuffled google could simply remove the top n content farms to improve search results look at the fake diy and cooking sites on youtube google could push them to the bottom yet they are often pushed to the top content farms have high production value and low value content but users will go first for slick looking and the kicker google generates revenue from ads on those pages put simply incentives are not aligned for google to make a good faith effort to remove low value content edit not sure not having to go to an additional site is a very good metric apply that idea to getting a mortgage getting medical advice hiring a contractor if someone tells me fertilzer xyz is best for my tomatoes you know what im going to do,0
i wish amazon would do this for their horrible ai selfpublished books in my niche i hate how they rip off my blog readers all the time,0
ive come so far i dont think you have the facilities for that big man,0
im surprised that google have such aggressive deadlines considering them not having any noticeable new products the past few years in addition to the closure of many of their products,0
i think that google is just trying to stay competitive with other tech companies it’s probably very difficult for them to allow people to advance in the company when you are always working with amazing talent and hard working people and regarding the perk dilemma to keep you working you can drive your own vehicle not eat dinner at google and also they offer fully remote positions i think the problem is employees especially new ones see the progress and dedication of other employees and work tirelessly in hopes of matching that same progress thus the burnout dilemma,0
i dont know really what do you people expect at workplace which pays you 10k a month minimum salary to just chill and play games of course its going to be stressful and hard,0
this channel should be suspended,0
615 this had we die laughing because of how stupid this video is especially this part ,0
i would expect spot to have this kind on versatility within five years it can already open doors turn knows flip switches a hurdle is how to limit natural language responsiveness you really dont want the robot to think you want it to put a bottle of ketchup in the microwave and zap it for five minutes,0
bing devs write that down write that down,0
so i decided to google myself the other day not because of my ego but i heard that there’s a possibility that the company i applied for googles their employees often the first thing that comes up when you search my name is the place i volunteered for almost 4 years and a college campus that i didn’t attend does anybody have a similar problem and if so how do you fix this,0
the worst part is that those private pictures between the doctor and parent were actually looked at by other people because of police investigation by their actions they turned it into what they claimed it was,0
if youre not doing anything wrong you definitively have something to fear its not paranoia when theyre actively looking for something to accuse you of,0
if everything youve ever said or done can be accessed taken completely without context and used against you with zero accountability then absolutely everybody has a lot to hide,0
this is terrifying imagine getting reported and registered as a predator because an algorithm from some big tech company has decided that something like this or maybe even family pictures from the beach are cp,0
the “why do you care if you don’t have anything to hide” mentality is how we get awful privacy violations like the patriot act,0
big tech having zero accountability has led to unbelievable levels of evil,0
big tech companies der repair industry bad for privacy and safety also bit tech companies privacy no we need to monitor you so we can accuse you without a proper investigation,0
im not convinced that opting out of googles security features does anything ive noticed with its phone tracking system that if i turn it off for a month and then turn it back on the next month i can go back in time and see the tracking from the previous month when it was off i think that they still track you and the only thing the toggle does is determine whether or not the user can see it and i believe this is also the case for other security features for this and other reasons ive been working on weaning myself off of google services for the last year or so,0
theres also been cases where someone follows their gps into flooded underpasses and drowned it was night they were unfamiliar with the area the water rose really fast locals kinda know where to stay clear of when it starts raining hard but its hard to navigate at night when visibility is already terrible,0
my uncle put up a sign outside of our family farm that says your gps is wrong because he kept getting strangers following faulty gps directions and ending up there ive also been in the car when a gps directed the wrong way down oneway streets or down nonexistent roads theyre useful but you have to apply some critical thinking when using them because they are ai with an emphasis on the a,0
even just the beginning of the story has me stressed out death valley is incredibly scary and if you go off the path youre basically guaranteed to get in serious trouble,0
i could not imagine that mother having to continue to fight for her life with her sons body nearby absolutely heartbreaking,0
fake,0
tip for the “what’s your weakness” question be sure to offer a weakness that is not directly needed in the job like if you need to be very organized in the job don’t say that as a weakness most people have several weaknesses offer something that is not directly needed in the job you are applying for even if you’re saying it’s something you’ve overcome or you’re working on now you don’t want to offer up a reason not to hire you also be sure to watch your facial expressions you may be super passionate and or just thinking  but you don’t want to come off as angry or frowning smile every once in a while haha much ,0
stephens face after gaga said she was assaulted made me tear up and then gagas absolute spot on description of trauma made me burst into tears,0
you can see the pain in his face when he’s not joking divorce is hard and so painful and to have people turn their backs on you compounds it i wish him well,0
this is honestly such a sad interview prayers for kenya gary the children  no family breaking up is easy especially after 23 years you can see the pain in his face,0
i know a couple that spoke to me separately after their divorce they had been married for 25 years at the time of their divorce filing i wanted to know why now… they both said if you see people getting divorced after 20 years they’ve been miserable for the last 10 years the wife said she was holding it together for the kids until they graduated high school both of them weren’t happy gary owen said he’d rather be happy than be in a toxic relationship i understand that… i pray his relationship with his kids is repaired,0
it’s annoying because they’re lowkey dragging him he’s still protecting his family props to him idk if i could deal with the backhanded energy,0
q whats your biggest weakness a job interviews,0
so in a nutshell never be honest tell the interviewer what they want to hear put on a charade got it,0
love how you have to manipulate and twist words and truths to make yourself presentable enough to hire cuz people dont actually want honest hardworking folk just people they can manipulate absolutely love it here,0
the key to nailing an interview is to always remind yourself that people dont want the truth they want validation,0
i got hit with the greatest weakness question i responded that sometimes im so focused on my work people feel as though im not very social i dont stand around at the watercooler gossiping about pop culture i keep my head down and get my work done it immediately was used against me in a negative manner i asked what was the major character in the candidate they were looking for they told me someone who talks to everyone lol it felt like such a setup,0
i am the softest bleeding heart youll ever find but when i hear about this guy killing and maiming innocent people who were just going to work i really dont give a shit that he has ptsd i have zero sympathy its one thing to beat up some guy whos in the racket but its another thing entirely when a guy who needs to pay the rent goes to work and gets shot by some tough guy yokel fuck that,0
i’m already nervous by watching this,0
im just way too uncomfortable and anxious in an interview and its frustrating because im not like that once im working im always prepared but the interview of course ends up being nothing i prepared for i had a situational interview today i didnt know it would be only situational for a school and they asked me how i would react to a school shooting situation i was like surprised inside but outside stayed calm because thats important i get why theyre asking but im like lock the doors and make sure the kids are secured who knows how i did i actually had a question about their safety protocols on my list but decided i wasnt going to ask it because it seemed inappropriate so it surprised me when they said it first i asked it in an interview at a hospital and they were very impressed that i was thinking ahead im in the usa if you didnt already guess that 2 interviews where the topic of a mass shooting situation came up and no they werent security jobs i dont even care really im finishing my 2nd novel and finding myself an agent then a cabin in the woods lol i cant take all this,0
the whole fight was like a movie all his lifes hardships led to that moment fathers murder migrating to a roughest part of a different country getting in trouble growing up 3 years of harassment 3 peice and soda almost losing that title shot opportunity on the last round against diaz fighting the main boss in usman the commentators being 100 sure that hell lose his coaches screaming dont feel sorry for yourself down to the final round everyone sure he is not winning it andboomheadshot the whole arena cheered and blew the roof off what a story,0
rechtswidrig pfffff övp kennt sowas nicht,0
furchtbarer typ dieser karner,0
i feel like i always prepare so much but still draw blanks because i am so nervous i have an interview in 15 mins and i’m trying to calm down edit i got the job,0
heartwarming to read the comments and see that the public is not buying the bs,0
the fact that y’all voted for this man is unbelievable,0
thank you i find the following interview questions a bit uncomfortable 1 how do you deal with difficult people 2 insisting on knowing the salary which is not nice,0
i lost a real savage to some bitch n only reason i cried i felt that rip king von,0
i have appointment august 30 am alittle bit  nervous and scared,0
my interview is august 30th i don’t know what the out come will be can someone wish me good luck i’m a bit nervous,0

spent the first seven years of my career teaching florencia 13 gangbangers in huntington park ca they were middle schoolers and spent the better part of the day trying to keep their pants up but as tough as they wanted you to believe they were most of them were just babies trying to fit in then i moved to a high school and stayed in touch with two who went in different directions one is now a highway patrol officer the other was murdered by his cousin at the direction of a rival gang to this day i feel more affection than fear for these lost souls,0
my first experience with gangs was working in a hospital and having a patient come in with severe trauma from a motorcycle accident he looked much like this guy tattooed from head to toe with his gang numbers and multiple scars from stabbings and gun shots the guy didnt make it and when we called the family to tell them he was dying his mothers reply was he brought this upon himself with the life he was living no one showed up through his dying process i ended up sitting with him after my shift was over until he passed in the end i didnt care what he had done in his life i just wanted him to know someone cared for him regardless my best to baldacci it sounds like he has people who love him and thats what matters ,0
its interviews like this that remind me every day that if im going in with preconceived judgement about a person im being an asshole this guy is so well spoken and can tell that he can definitely put his good intentions into a powerful direction he should take up writing so he can tell his story,0
adam kills me when he puts all of his great journalistic interviewing skills into people outside of his sphere yet back at the no jumper office he just talks in circles about nonsense ,0

i think we killed them huh ya dont say caught me off guard,0
for people that dont understand it we all know afton hates being in the suit because its infinite suffering if they kill him he gets to rest peacefully and they dont want that because he needs to pay by suffering until the world ends or something,0
this guy really just said people are too judgemental haha,0
i think socially awkward young men who don’t have friends and have no real skills or education tend to be drawn into cults like this because it gives them a chance to belong to something this guy is a shining example of that,0
this dude contradicts himself multiple times…sometimes within the same sentence lol but you can see the being in the kkk has wrecked his life more than anything this dude lost the love of his life and it’s still very obvious that he is in love with her and misses her but his own beliefs make it impossible for them to be together he knows that love is love says love sees no color but then says race mixing is wrong lol i think his heart speaks the truth and then what’s been brainwashed comes out that’s why he contradicts himself so much,0
to see a grown man dressed in this weird outfit playing judge and juror assuming that he has the ability to fix society just based on his coloris a sad state of affairs we are in trouble,0
he said man to man like he aint got security close by  stop it vlad,0
man ray never disappointsi dont feel virally,0
this episode felt like a trolling contest ,0
excuse me no lobster talk,0
your nose and stash look like a combo with your glasses,0
i died when boosie said im not finished ,0
how can you not like this man he’s going to keep it 100 every time he opens his mouth,0
how the great pyramids were built yeah im still wondering this show sure didnt explain how they were built,0
i defer to geologist geology is a true science archeology not so much nobody can explain how they were quarried transported and built the fact that egyptologists not scientists btw stick their story of when they were built is outrageous,0
“world governments lay in ruins major cities smolder from the attack and those who have managed to survive struggle with a sparse food supply” that’s a description of the present day lol,0
aliens are intelligent enough to see that our governments are doing a good enough job at destroying the world,0
i’m always wondering how those people immediately think we would need to fight back a species that doesn’t even showed itself yet for better or worse,0
the most advanced aggressive alien species is less of a threat to humanity than the earthly powers in control,0
of all the multiple universes and the infinity of it all why would we be a threat to any aliens or better yet why would aliens even notice our existence especially if we are as a planet near destruction anyway,0
this still makes the aliens too primitive and human like more than likely theyd just turn everything off like a giant emp and use some sort of frequency that affects our nervous system knocking us out then they come down to collect what they want or to take over is it exciting full of action giving the humans a chance to take a stand no but its more efficient and something an advanced species would do,0
its so sad to think of how many fossils were lost,0
this is proof that people are strange and have been strange for a very very long time,0
himmlers death isn’t entirely accurate he was detained for a short time and although it was reported that he had died from a cyanide capsule he was thoroughly strip searched for such an item and during his autopsy it was noted that he had lots of strange bruises all over his face that were not present when he had arrived some suspect that he was beaten to death historian and youtuber “mark felton” researched this very subject about himmler in a youtube series called “the death of himmler” i cannot recommend his videos enough his videos remind me of what the military channel once was before it became the american hero’s channel if anyone remembers that,0
i read a book about the battle of berlin and it talked about how those foreign ss units fought to the bitter end since many had no countries to go back to because they have been captured by the allies,0
goerings original message to hitler was very concilatory and respectfully asked if a transfer of power was neccessary unfortunately for goering the message fell into the hands of martin bormann who despised him bormann changed the tone of the message to make it look like goering was issuing and ultimatum,0
what surprises me most with this video is how many people were aware of hitlers demise and whom tried to destroy his body i grew up continually surrounded with ppl expressing doubts that hitler had actually killed himself it seems pretty clear that he did,0
did not know about most of his cabinet took their lives but killing their own children that upset me how could any parent ever think of doing that i realize those types of deaths still happen today just going to show you barbarism still exists its not as if those children could be tried for war crimes i think we all know those parents have rotted in hell praise the lord,0
as a vietnam veteran with ptsd i can honestly say you have your moments this is a mental illness but depending on what you experienced in a war it can bring back certain events ten years of therapy in 1999 denied you dont have ptsd but now va says chronic ptsd i grew it over the last 23 years i was awarded ptsd this month my grandson joined the army at age 31 he did not need to do that skilled in plumbing and heating making about 40 per hour with 1012 years of experience but my influence as a us army veteran of 13 years only 18x training,0
i have ptsd and it has nothing to do with violent outbursts it is more along the lines of being unable to stop thinking about what you saw or what happened you keep thinking about the event and you eventually start living your life by avoiding anything that might remind you of what happened to get it to stop replaying in your head this can be at all different levels from avoiding certain types of people to avoiding groups public transportation or in some cases avoiding people altogether violence can be a normal response to many stressful situations but most people with ptsd arent violent if anything most people go out of our way to avoid violence or confrontation i guess the stereotype arises when people turn to drugs and especially alcohol to help them stop thinking about what happened and the alcohol is what causes the violent outbursts the idea of someone mistaking you as some enemy and attacking you is a myth at least ive never met anyone like that or experienced anything like that you dont have real flashbacks like hallucinations you just can not stop thinking about what happened why it happened how you could have stopped it and etc like anyone in a traumatic event issue is usually it goes away after a bit where in ptsd you still keep dwelling on it years later,0
i can confirm that drill sergeants constantly curse at trainees the whole drill sergeants cant swear at people anymore myth is bogus,0
as far as shoot to kill goes were trained to aim for center mass of the body this lessens the change of missing however its actually better to severely wound an enemy soldier than outright killing him the reason being that now others who could be fighting or otherwise engaged in some valuable task have to care for and transport the injured soldier thereby using up resources and personnel as cold as it sounds a dead soldier becomes a supply problem,0
as a marine with 7 years of service i can say that hazing 100 exists and is an integral part of marine corps basic training full metal jacket was the most accurate representation but it’s more than that also you don’t shoot unless it’s to kill not to disarm not to scare but to kill and if you’re with anyone that’s afraid to do so you can’t trust them to have your back,0
my great uncle served 2 tours in vietnam as a medical huey pilot he came back with ptsd and his episodes are usually panicking or scans the room he only got violent once when a burglar triggered him when he pulled a knife on my great aunt the guy is currently still recovering in the hospital 3 months later,0
when i was drafted in 1964 my starting pay was 99 per month when i got married later that year my wifes allotment of 230 per month was more than twice my base pay and when i was injured in a role as support for a certain civilian agency violating the law in southeast asia i was called a liar and threatened with a court martial i am proud of my service to my country but being in the service ducks,0
this like so many other documentaries just barely scratch the surface of the secrets these ancient times and civilizations keep i believe we will never truly fathom the depth of their engineering feats,0
when your world history test is in 20 minutes and you haven’t studied,0
“you could make a religion out of this“ “no don’t”,0
i literally cant miss any second or ill miss an entire civilization,0
its crazy how much actual footage of historical events this man has squashed into one video,0
summer in the uk the sun is a deadly lazer winter in the uk not anymore theres a blanket clouds,0
honestly captain kidd just seems like a guy who desperately wanted to climb the social ladder but his failure as a privateer and the pressure from his crew made him an unwilling pirate,0
how disappointing captain kidd being one of only 4 pirates i could name had a very short and minor career compared to other pirates,0
people either love him or hate him i see a man who was a great opportunist and understood how the world works tell me how he is worst than the institutions run today by men but hide from their bunkers he fought with his men gave epic speeches and rewarded his staff and troops greatly he gave men a reason to live even if self motivated when i listen to people british who hate him they sound envious yes he plunder the church but didn’t kill any clergyman— which is uncommon in war historians hide behind the “but the crown was corrupt so the revolution followed” no bro power wealth will always be corrupt these people wanted violence for free healthcare take a hike napoleon was no saint but i rather my country be an empire lead by a patriot than some international court,0
i remember when the history channel had shows about history i miss that,0
one of my all time favorites shows along with modern marvels from a long gone era in the history of history channel shame it went downhill with all their “reality” programming alien conspiracies pawn and swamp idiots,0
seeing the pictures of the children brought tears to my eyes,0
we need to see what man can do to man children who were viewed as mentally deficient were wiped out by the nazi regime among others who didnt fit an aryan profile it happened then and can happen again so many atrocities still go on to this day,0
animals wouldnt do these horrible things to each other,0
who elses sleep schedule got ruined my history bls ,0
“i’m getting married” top 10 anime betrayals,0
those first couple minutes made me feel like i jumped into the koolaid without knowing the flavor then they kissed and i was oooooh ok were lemonade mixed with saddness and betrayal ,0
the way he ran from him in the beginning is how i run from my homework responsibility and my mom who is running with a sandal in her hand ready to kill me,0
…why wasn’t the great oxidation event included on this list the worst extinction event that killed off close to all prior anaerobic microscopic forms of life,0
at the beginning they mention the oceans stagnating but i find that troubling with the effects of the moon plate tectonics wouldn’t they have had a more significant impact on the earth i get confused when our land mass was a combined continent but there’s no mention of that as a factor in these earlier extinctions or are we meant to know that ourselves also there would’ve been more frequent meteor impacts at that time too although they’d be harder to prove but i wouldn’t know i’m certainly no expert on the subject i just rely on logic,0
yeah we are most definitely going to inevitably be our own downfall we may have the tools and technology to weather some disasters but we depend so much on the infrastructures we have set up to the point where most people probably wouldnt know what to do without wifi and cellular data let alone weather catastrophic effects on our food sources and supply chains,0
“he attempted to take british somaliland which went pretty well he then attempted to take egypt which went less well then he attempted to take greece which went really badly churchill began to describe italy as europe’s soft underbelly”,0
the greek civil war is still an incredibly taboo topic in modern greek society so much unnecessary death atrocities and war crimes committed by both sides neither left nor right wingers really want to talk about it but the unmended scar it has left to the greek people till this day is undeniable most greeks today have or might have had a relative or family friends that will have horror stories to tell because of this war,0
can you imagine not having direct sunlight for a year and having no idea why even wondering if the sun would shine the same ever again terrifying,0
536 ad is the estimated timeframe that the krakatoa volcano experienced an extremely massive eruption that caused a column of smoke ash and debris 13 miles high so much material was ejected into the atmosphere that it shrouded the earth causing temperature drops and ensuing human suffering krakatoa would erupt massively again around 1200 and the most recent climatechanging eruption was in the 1880s the 1880s eruption was estimated to be equivalent to 160 megatons the tsar bomba was a measly 57 megatons in comparison,0
i can’t believe the way you calculated fahrenheit temperature change made it past any review a change of 16 degrees celsius is a change of 288 degrees fahrenheit a temperature of 16 degrees celsius is slightly above freezing or a temperature of 32288 348 degrees fahrenheit,0
the fact this was released on the beginning of the pandemic and is now 2 years old  this horror never ends even the catastrophe mentioned here only lasted 18 months,0
the more i learn the more i think i’m being punished for being born,0
you forgot one of the worst things because little ice age sparked crop faliures it also brought the real migrations of peoples from north which is in achaeology one of the most important and devastatingfor romans parts of history it really brought a nail in the coffin for eastern roman empire,0
when i failed an exam my dad told me “at your age alexander already conquered half of persia why aren’t you”,0
alexander died because of back injury he carried his team so much,0
imagine being the person responsible for making an entire generation dumber on average that’s a sad legacy to leave behind,0
accidentally is a bit generous considering he knew the dangers and intentionally covered them up,0
this sounds like a perpetrated crime against not just humanity but all life on earth rather than just an accident a crime perpetrated by corporations not one man,0
“ you will observe with concern how long a useful truth may be known and exist before it is generally received and practiced on” will now be my favorite quote it’s sad how often ppl prove benjamin franklins words true he would probably be very disappointed with the ignorance and misinformation we’re surrounded by,0
just as a point of order he didnt accidentally harm or kill millions of people he and others knew the consequences of their actions but was prepared for others to py the ultimate price for his pieces of silver greed is and will continue to be the downfall of mankind,0
ironic isnt it that in the long race a scientist who worked to create the nuclear bombs went to save humanity and the other working for the betterment of society would actually end up poisoning it,0
very good story on how lead emissions from automobiles have effected humanity but even heavier amounts of lead possibly 10000 times higher were in the average household during that same time period most paints contained extremely high levels of lead many millions of infants would have set their teeth grinding away at the paintwork on the side of their crib not to mention most of their metal toys were liberally coated with lead paint plumbers used a combination of red lead paint and hemp as thread sealer for household water pipes most pencils had a high lead concentration hence the phrase get some lead in your pencil house roofing had lead flashing and many homes had a rain water collection tank for drinking water i could go on and on so my argument is that the regular household was probably a bigger contributor to the lead poisoning of the people than just the automobile solder usually 6040 lead tin combination also heavily used in household plumbing as well as electrical and electronic equipment so you can see the averages home of that same era had copious amounts of lead levels to blame the the automobile totally for the spike in lead poisoning would be a seriously biased view,0
the aliens in florence just wanted to watch the game and threw out glitter as a celebration they were probably hella disappointed when they canceled the game they were just trying to turn up,0
i love a good mystery as much as any1 but it really really annoys me that a lot of ppl always jump the most far out explanation however improbable or even impossible such as aliens even when there are numerous possible explanations that are both simple and commonplace but then those are the same ppl who will disregard any fact that doesnt fit their tinfoil hat theory and cherrypick usable facts they twist and change to fit them or just plain invent facts sorry if im pissing off all the conspiracy buffs but when i hear hoofbeats my first thought isnt zebras or even worse aliens,0
1 “one of the darkest historical mysteries” … really do you know how many ships have been lost of the last 1000 years,0
1100 serfdom never took off it never took off because it was made illegal by magnus ladulås about a centruy before this the nobles tried passing their serfs of as slaves to circumvent the law so magnus son rolled his eyes and made slavery illegal too,0
scott im becoming a skeptic of your show its interesting but not much gets solved and some of it is pretty far fetched you didnt even convince the guy at the lab on this one you do need skeptics on your show just to give a counter argument instead of people who just agree there could be logical reasons that your show is not presenting that may counter what you show,0
scott you make good entertaining shows that titillate the imagination but you are anything but objective and are always seeking the grandiose explanation you know this is seldom the case templars lost tribes bigfoot cmon dude,0
i was honestly terrified of abomination in hulk ultimate destruction as a kid i hope they dont ruin him,0
rick jones becoming abomination is also probably a call back to him being abomb who was just a blue abomination with more spikes,0
1707 a small correction he was named saitō musashibo benkei and its a shame you didnt include the battle of shiroyama where the man who took a big role in modernizing the new imperial japanese army was ultimately killed with his band of 500 samurai whom were originally 20 000 at the start of the satsuma rebellion he was named saigō takamori,0
in ww2 a dentist in the pacific was working as a surgeon when 5000 japanese soldiers attacked his position he told the wounded to retreat and he held the base until he died his body was surrounded by 91 dead bodies of the japanese,0
im irish i learned all about history from my mom when i was 16 she told all about the slave trade and the holocaust i would feel very sad that any human could do that to another human she told us never forget these atrocities because the evil people on this planet would do the same again if they got away with it,0
it takes an absolute monster to treat other human beings like that,0
my great great grandmother was 13 when she boarded a slave ship from africa and we have pictures of her in her 90s it wasnt that long ago and any calls to get over and forget about it is disrespectful to what they had to endure so that we could live,0
i cried literally through the whole video slavery is a subject that focuses my energy into anger and sadness but i’m learning to refocus that for my good using the past to fuel my future,0
ive never watched the movie but the book 12 years a slave was so descript and disturbing although there were times i had to put the book down i really like how it brought much more light to the tortures and horrendous practices performed by the yt man and the yt woman textbooks in high school never went into the details of physical and mental punishments all i was ever taught about was whippings beatings and a little about the rapings but there was so much more that only an inhumane brute could think of doing solomon northup described them a lot as demoniac being possessed with an evil spirit and soulless seedofesau,0
some vikings complained the baptism they were just given wasnt as nice as the last one lmao,0
misleading title more about transition from hunting and gathering to herding and agriculture increase from small scale fishing to industrial scale some mention of fish farming and aquaculture nothing about how people learned to cook their food,0
i live in volgogradstalingrad all the veterans i saw said that this battle was a real hell when the asphalt is repaired or the pipeline is replaced the remains of soldiers are still found in the ground and 70 years have passed,0
the germans really did hand the soviets a beachhead fortress in this city with all the bombed rubble it only became more of a nightmare to advance into,0
a couple of my distant german family members were at stalingrad and are still there as far as i know none of the family know when or where they died exactly but there are oak trees planted on the family land as a memorial i only learnt this while looking through family history trying to learn more about my roots they were barely in their 20s conscripted and sent to fight im now older than they were and i couldnt imagine going through that sort of living hell i understand they were on the wrong side and i absolutely respect the russians for defending their homeland but whenever i hear the word stalingrad it makes me think of those guys war is a waste so much potential in humanity just thrown away at the whims of the people in power,0
thank you for mentioning the real reason behind the 227 order so many people think it was just a cruel note allowing kgb monsters to shoot soldier at whim but please do stop addressing soviets as russians there were soldiers of many nations in the red army and they do not deserve to be forgotten,0
my grandfather fought on the german side from the beginning to the bitter end of this battle then spent months working inside a gulag as a miner finally escaping few days before his unit was signed for execution he never wanted to talk much about the war only few stories about his comrades and struggle for survival i guess he felt ashamed for all the suffering nazis brought to this world i remember the day i asked him about it he didnt say anything my grandmother took me on a side and told me to never ask him about a stalingrad,0
any entertainment channel you watch will never tell you any of the real bad stuff they are doing they will give you some small nuggets of truth but never tell you whats really going on,0
the information we get through public domain is channelized and censored so that people should never know about them it is just laughable to allow a tv show to sell all your secrets so whatever they share you cannot really tell whether it is the whole truth or just an explanation to keep you away from too much of thinking i appreciate the concept of the show and it is binge worthy that is for sure but it cannot be honest,0
i remember reading an article about an apartment building that kept making people sick and they suspected mold but couldnt find any it turned out that the air conditioning ducts were making a high pitch frequency sound that was making people sick,0
i guess im a true conspiracy theorist because i dont think anyone that would actually know if any of these things existed would tell the truth and those that dont know for sure are only expressing an opinion,0
we live in northern california took a ride through the destruction no doubt about it ive seen what napalm can do and it burns at 2000° where aluminum melts there were many trees standing in untouched by the flames and right next to it was a vehicle whose aluminum wheels melted down the driveway yeah right no doubt about it,0
i think the worst year to be born is 1901 you would of been involved in two world wars spanish influenza and the great depression all before you turn 45,0
ive always gotten a little confused when people classified 2020 as the worst year to be alive in there are so many past years that didnt have as much technology to go off of like we did during the pandemic like at least we had stuff to do locked in our homes,0
as an indian it was heart wrenching to watch what happened to the native american tribes of america my heart goes out to the survivors,0
though reminding ourselves of the horrific times in the past might console us to get through this pandemic you cant deny that the definition of catastrophic is different for everyone the inequalities are huge the rosy picture you showed is probably in developed nations people have lost jobs lives dignity even democracies each time period has its own set of limitations and challenges ours is different,0
everyones understandind of the situation is relative to their own subjective experience it is unfair to make comparisons bewtween the past and the present without taking into account all the different variables which is practically impossible its like electricity going out and you saying you think thats bad ackchually humans lived without electricity for thousands of yeears of course thats a ridiculous statement because humans in the past were not nearly as dependent on electricity as we are now and even though it may not have been important to them to us no electricity for just a month could mean the dissolution of the world as we know it so please dont make ignorant comparisons between the present and the past as if things were indeed that simple,0
you know im glad i live in the here and now when i was 11 i got a very aggressive case of scoliosis that would have killed me the very year id gotten it if i hadnt had major surgery i hate to imagine just how many people have died from this condition and many others throughout history,0
a guy i used to know at school got hit by the same car in the same place twice almost exactly 5 years apart,0
my grandmother was a teenager living on a farm with her mother and father during these times in dongguan which has been the electronics manufacturer of the world for the past 10 years in the guangdong province her father died rather abruptly from inhaling toxic gases while clearing a crude drainage system on the farm and left my grandmother and her mother behind she says that before her farm was confiscated by the ccp her mother was actually compensated the equivalent of pennies on the dollar of what the farmland was worth but they really didnt have a choice in the matter there would always be distant relatives and strangers that would stay on their farm and freeload because they had nowhere else to go had no money and were starving my grandmothers mother was kind hearted and took in these less fortunate people as best as her means could provide at some point she housed and fed more than 1520 of them for many of them it was a sojourn whilst making their way down to hong kong which was free from the troubles of china at the time many had heard of the prosperity that the british colony had brought and wanted a piece of the pie some years later even my wifes father had swam across the seas to illegally enter hong kong when the government at the time announced they were issuing id cards for citizenship albeit his heart still belongs to china as the indoctrination that generation was subject to to them was really profound he would often complain to his children why do all of you not love china and they would retort if you love china so much what are you doing in hong kong to which he would become frustrated for having no good answer i asked my grandmother once do you think mao zedong is good and she enthusiastically answers without a second of hesitation yes yes hes wonderful and started blurting out the first few phrases of the chinese national anthem in song i guess its why that generation is called the lost generation,0
it shocks me how this man manage to surpass the death toll of ww1 with the great leap forward,0
meanwhile stalin is over here like what do i have to do to make this fing list,0
someone stated a prophecy is only useful if it is clear enough for us to take action and prevent some harm or gain some favor i like that nostradamus prophecies didnt help us prevent hitler,0
it’s almost as of they’re conditioning the masses to prepare for something,0
also theres no way hitler wasnt 1 of the 3 antichrists his sins are unforgiveable,0
im surpised they actually got the greek definition right instead of christ or cristos but then 10 seconds later they get it wrong about the devils son its the devil defacto,0
nellie bly actually wrote her experience being in a mental hospital when she faked insanity and the book is called 10 days in a madhouse i suggest anyone read it its tragic but if it werent for her faking insanity and witnessing what she did it wouldnt have changed the course of mental health care like it did when her story got out they also made it into a movie thats here on youtube,0
sounds like a great way to develop ptsd anxiety and panic disorders youll end up with issues if you didnt start with one,0
imagine being depressed and suicidal then you end up in a prison where you’re tortured and beat daily because of it how were people actually this dumb lol,0
it’s scary to think if i were born just 70 years ago i’d be institutionalized permanently for the illnesses that i have,0
my evil grandmother threw my aunt into an institution when she was a kid my aunt didn’t have a mental illness my grandmother was just abusive and cruel,0
while i wish i could experience life in the past i always realize i’d die within the first 5 minutes,0
as someone with adhd im just happy i wasnt alive in those times i have a feeling that i might have ended up in one just because i was hard to handle at school seeing how i had a teacher throw an eraser at me in kindergarten while i still think we have a long way to go to be able to not make mental illness so taboo we have also come a long way but im worried well step backward if were not careful,0
alot of these “crazy” patients were undiagnosed with autism and other developmental related disorders fortunately behavior analyst came it and took care of the unwanted “insane” people it really is a sad story how these “doctors” would not want to treat any of them,0
my sis got sent to a mental facility one time when she had a breakdown one of the employees there made fun of the cuts on her arms… in addition to this another person there got a hold of a razor and slit her wrists and everyone had to witness they were treated just as much like prisoners then as previous asylums our system hasn’t changed much at all unfortunately,0
yes it seems like the line between law enforcement criminality and vigilantism was extremely thin,0
well just yesterday we had a brawl involving 25 people in broad daylight and infront of the police station and today one guy was shot in the back and we had a hit and run just before i saw your video i was saying to myself its becoming like the wild west lately yup theres been an upscale of violence,0
1 in 200 chance of becoming a homicide victim in the us 2015 is not even close to correct how was that recorded and no one thought hmm that seems high first two things you will find when you google is chances of being murdered in united states in any given year is about 1 in 18989 in 2015 specifically there was about 554 fatalities per every 100000 people,0
why do people write we do people paint why do people do anything its for the same reasons today,0
i dont know why scientists have not done dna testing on such art works it is obvious that they used saliva to mix the pigments to make their paintings,0
i take deep exception with the image of ozzy osborne being used as an example of celebrity not known for what they do ozzy is a veritable treasure and god of music how dare you right after the kardashians really wtf,0
umm i think somebody forgot king leopold ll of belgium the man bled the congo so badly that once it gained independence nobody remembered how to farm crops let alone run a country,0
in the case of king john ive always found it funny that he was so bad at his job that an entire country had to completely restructure their government because of him,0
there were atrocious kings but a lot of atrocities amongst commoners too,0
you put our national hero vlad tepes on your stupid list of evil kings vlad was a hero who fought for his people and country against the ottoman empire he was betrayed by the nobles and spend 12 years in prison in modern day hungary yes his methods were cruel but he never punished innocent people,0
your take on the habsburgs is wildly inaccurate they didnt rule over the holy roman empire they reigned due to the hundreds of independent principalities marquisates archbishoprics free cities and electors not even the emperor charles v could break this political logjam the later empire was enlightened by current european standards and im not saying this because im a fan of theirs im not but lets be accurate shall we,0
im hungarian i can assure you atilla is only seen as evil by those that are not hungarian horrible acts were made on both sides but his people had no home thanks to him now we do,0
important for people not to fake etufo stuff because it makes real ones seem fake,0
i really wish people would stop hoaxing this stuff that’s why people have such trouble taking this topic seriously,0
these experts oknot an alienbut the reasons they give to prove its not an alien are ridiculous,0
the one thing i hate about these shows and the people in them is that they state their own hypothesis or that of others but state them as fact not as what they are hypothesis opinion or at most very well educated guesses the only way to claim those cave paintings are one thing beyond a shadow of a doubt would be to talk to the actual creators of the images shame on them for lying,0
the maritime disaster that was the sinking of the titanic in 1912 lives on in memory still in the 21st century how remarkable is that really one of the startling facts for me is that it sank in just under three hours with a loss of 1500 people it must have been terrifying especially as it happened in the dark one of the most eerie things ive ever watched is when scientists finally found the wreck a great distance from where they thought it would be they were in a mini sub and the bulk of the ship just loomed out of the darkness it was truly weird i dont like deep water in fact terra firma for me thank you great video neil see you tomorrow,0
i was watching a detective story from the 1990’s and found myself thinking “why don’t they get out their mobile phone” of course i then recalled they didn’t actually have them then the younger generations must really find old shows difficult to relate to much more so than we did there were far fewer significant lifestyle changes between 1940 and 1980 than between 1980 and 2022 i feel,0
what parts of the standard american history myth did you believe john adams and thomas jefferson were founding fathers but they didnt attend the constitutional convention my bad,0
my 10th grade us history teacher announced to us that we would be taking a pop quiz that was worth 50 of our grade and told us we had to get every answer right otherwise we failed she handed us the literacy tests and said we had 10 minutes to complete it beside our understandable confusion as to what this had to do with history we all failed terribly thats when she came out and told us that had we been black over 100 years ago none of us would have been able to vote in the south and told us these were the literacy tests the curriculum told her to teach us about she is still my favorite teacher to this day because she had such an amazing way of personalizing historic events to us,0
this video has made my heart seethe with rage as a white young adult myself my great grandfather experienced the hardships of sharecropping and i regret every day that he is not with us for me to learn and record his experiences on an even worse level the ignorance of my grandfathers generation on the peonage system and their tendency to spout black criminality rhetoric saddens me it amazes me how racism can fester so immensely with even the most impoverished folk my thoughts and prayers go out that future generations take the important duty of learning this history in a more complete manner than mine your line delivery in this video is outstanding your passion and sincerity in your presentation of these sad facts shows just how good of a man you are bravo and may every man and woman of every nation know these and all other historical horrors for the betterment of tomorrow and beyond,0
showed this clip to a reading class im teaching here in the sf bay area9th graders and one of the ideas that came out of the class is that imagination and empathytwo of the main skills strengthened by readingcan be antidotes to cynicism and indifference two of the really toxic aspects of the culture young people have to deal with,0
this makes me want to start reading again its been too long since i really read a book basically since school back then i didnt like to be forced to read i find it difficult to get hooked and im also quite a slow reader who could give me some suggestions to give it another try,0
pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart the really great men must i think have great sadness on earth” ― fyodor dostoevsky crime and punishment,0
“grownup people do not know that a child can give exceedingly good advice even in the most difficult case” ― fyodor dostoyevsky the idiot,0
we want happiness but we have a special talent of making ourself miserable cdostoevsky,0
our pain moves in an area of ​​vast sadness we dont find paws that wipe the weights of steadfast fear off our shoulders all suspicions wake up to the sound of doubt coming from the mouths of the traitors nothing compares to the sails departing from the ports of memories have you seen with the eyes of your dreams the mirage of years in the seasons of false wish return to your deserted consciences you poets who escaped from the prison of iron despair there are flowers waiting for your words for a winter touch in the summer of burning words ali suroor,0
a really great video though i found the background music very distracting and had to watch it on mute with the captions which was disappointing,0
alone i often fall down into nothingness i must push my foot stealthily lest i should fall off the edge of the world into nothingness i have to bang my head against some hard door to call myself back to the body virginia woolf the waves,0
isnt there a certain irony to virginia woolf she detested the snobbery of the time she lived in and yet her books have created a new kind of snobbery in literature and academia,0
utterly baffling to a reader in a hurry well said,0
fun fact after the release of the book the sorrows of the young werther this has caused a chain reaction of suicides in europe this cause of suicide effects has been later called as the werthereffect,0
how can one spend his entire life working on something and then not have 13 hours to see the whole thing,0
i cannot imagine any television networks making these sort of programs these days it is rather depressing because 1980s is rather recent for some of us at that time we were worried about dumbing down of culture yet there were still plenty of high brow culture covered by main stream media in retrospect 1980s may have been the last era in which high culture would have any part to play in television,0
does anyone have a lovehate relationship with analyzing literature like when the teacher explains the deep meaning of something it makes total sense and logic to get to that point of analytical conclusion but when i try to find a meaning of something it always turns out to be wrong even though there’s technically no correct way to analyze a text perfectly it just doesn’t make sense to me when i would get a 75 on a analysis paper just because the teacher didn’t seeanalyze what i wrote about a certain text,0
this is why i pretty much lost a significant focus on writing and critical analysis much of the following is due to bad memory but everything i would say and write as my own point of view on the understanding of a characters situation i would get it wrong maybe i needed to grow up from such a sheltered environment and know first hand what the characters in the novels essays were going through i was only a kid,0
stuff is always so open to interpretation i ragequit before a few chapters trying to analyze literature it takes all the joy of reading out of me,0
this video doesnt even mention his humor which is abundant alongside the tragedy and darkness,0
the saddest of us are usually cursed to see the happiness that isnt there,0
the task of literature is to reconnect us with feelings that might otherwise be unbearable to study but which desperately need our attention so intense damn,0
i cried so much kafka is filled with deepest most harmful dark inner feelings within us all i wish his father read his letter though,0
“charles dickens likes to write sentences longer than the mississippi river” resonated so deeply with my soul like this man is one of my all time favorite authors and yet he makes my adhd brain suffer all the gd time,0
every time i watch your videos about philosophy literature psychology and sociology i am left with one very unsatisfying thought there are so many books in the world that i want to read and dont feel like i will ever have the time to though im only in my early 20s,0
his life is so wholesome and laddish at the same time from being a drunk gambling layabout pestering gypsy women then getting bored and becoming an officer to penning literary masterpieces about inner kindness and understanding then just walking out on your family and dying of pneumonia absolute madman,0
this video arrived at the most opportune moment i started off college im currently a sophomore with studying biochem and holy hell was it torture before starting college i thought i really liked science and it is what my parents dreamed for me to study even most of my cousins have studied something stem science tech engineering and math related while i did ok in my first semesters i felt really depressed and suffocated my mental health was at its lowest it was a terrible time for me i realized i did not like what i was studying at all and the pressure i felt from my family made it much worse a week ago i talked with my academic advisor and we discussed about changing majors from biochem to english let me tell you i breathed a sigh of relief and almost broke down in front of her when i was able to switch to an english major,0
this is for those who arent in a very privileged situation and want to take literature and writing i am a third year college student studying creative writing in a country that gives importance to stem courses and careers my family is not at all financially stable and yet im studying in one of the most prestigious schools in the country i have often felt guilty about this choice of mine because i know my parents do not 100 understand my choice yet they have to pay for my tuition but luckily for me my parents support me 100 i feel this stress to quickly find a job after college and our country doesnt have a lot of opportunities for writers too but i know this is the path i want to take o want to work with books so i just try my best to push down the feelings of fear because i know that if i stay in this path and do my absolute best to find the perfect career i would be happy for myself and my family to those in a similar position as me my word of advice is to just follow what you think is right for you follow what will make you happy because it is you who will be living with that decision 3 i dont regret my choice,0
whats even more crazy is that jane austen wasnt formally recognized as a great writer until the 1920s during her life people did not largely read her work and it wasnt until many decades later when a harvard scholar wrote a seminal paper on her work did she finally get attention,0
i dont think that dickens shortcomings as a husband and parent were a result of the difficulty of being great at two things at the same time but rather is an example of how difficult it is to overcome the emotional spiritual and psychic damages inflicted by an unhappy childhood while he was able to turn his pain and suffering into art quite an achievement he wasnt able to heal emotionally its usually easier to deal with such things in abstract intellectual and artistic ways he was in many ways driven by his demons and that can surprisingly take you very far in life but it doesnt make you a better person in fact the success may militate against real change,0
it really made me sad that this person was so great and dedicated in his work but at the same time at the expense of terrible relations with his wife and 10 children…it’s just so freaking sad you can never have it all can you,0
as a nonnative english speaker i would literally die to speak like you so clear,0
me going into chemical engineering but still a literature nerd watches this entire thing for no reason,0
really needed this because i have a weird relationship with classics i haven’t even started frankenstein for the book club because i’m genuinely scared lol,0
ever heard the line he knew everything about literature except how to enjoy it that kinda applies here i never analyze a book or film on the first go it takes away the magic,0
“those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities” ― voltaire,0
i’d love to see andrew do more literature based videos as a conservative patron of the arts i feel pretty alone amidst the utter desecration of the greats by the left shakespeare has been cancelled in some universities in the uk where i am from,0
dude this is driving me crazy instead of travelling the world and having fun im here struggling to write a literature review,0
none are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free,0
sophisticated entertainment and empty headed news reports all wrapped up in a constant reference to freedom sounds like america,0
id just like to point out that odysseus sleeping around was necessary for his survival if a powerful goddess like circe or calypso wants to have sex with you you dont have much choice if you reject them it could spell doom for you or your loved ones horny gods punishing mortals for denying them sex is a recurring theme throughout classical mythology,0
the odyssey is homer unwriting the iliad when odysseus raids cheats and behaves generally like a iliadic hero he is at his weakest and at the beginning of his odyssey by the end he refuses to cheat on his wife with the incredible fantastic nausica he shows almost inhuman patience and selfcontrol in the face of the suitors abuse and he choses nostos over kleos the choice achilles couldnt stand to make whats more achilles himself discredits the entire premise of the iliad when odysseus sees him down in the land of the dead by saying that it is better to be the lowest slave than king among all the unnumbered dead and he doesnt lie to everyone he knows his cretan narratives are really important nonviolent defenses against a situation similar to agamemnon and clytemnestra,0
please dont ever stop making literature videos because we dont have english literature in high school in where i live and i want to study it so bad even if my english is really not good,0
so even odysseus who is wise enough to be praised by athena for his wisdom loses himself in war does that say something about our attraction to war,0
this should be titled how to search for a literature review not how to write one,0
firstly screening the literature is the most important aspect of a systematic review and for any other types sonot teaching students how to use ovid medline cochrane tec and only relying on pubmed is certainly the worst start up you miss such a large number of studies that whatever conclusion you try to draw will be biased and therefore unreliable,0
this vid is its too short hilarious wish it was longer,0
here is the transcript the literature review is not an essay it is not a research paper the literature review is part of your essay the literature review is part of your research paper or maybe standalone product if youre masters degree or doctoral degree program and you have to do that for but regardless of whether part of the research essay or standalone product one thing the literature review does not do is it doesn’t prove state illustrate collaborate or develop your main point thats in the body of your essay the literature review does not do that it does not provide the body or development section up your affect or your paper well what the heck does it do then well the literature review is divided into the following key terms first is the whole idea of what the heck in the literature the literature is simply those major works that have been published about your narrow topic now remember i said narrow topic we are not going to be reviewing every published thing on a broad topic like steroid use by athletes you could have a more narrow topic like steroid use by high school affiliates or steroid use by baseball players into you going to be reviewing the major works just on that narrow topic thats the first thing that you need to know the literature is published peer reviewed sources on in narrow topic second thing the literature review is that narrow topic in all those sources published on it are going to be reviewed what the heck of a review well review is simply a way of looking at something in taking a snapshot of it what is that snapshot going to capture that snapshot going to capture major concepts the major point the major outcome the major whatever in that source it’s not going to be a detailed write up of that source going to be a snapshot once you get all those snapshot done you going to show the relationship between those snapshot and talking about those relationships you probably going to be pulling them in some kind of timeline situation maybe not but the key years is you’re going to be extracting just the major element in then relationship among those major element may be on a time line type of situation now the next thing to know about them going to reviewers why theyre hack are you doing all this stuff well i think there are three reasons probably why youre doing all this stuffs in school in the first one off course to improve your own understanding as an undergraduate researcher coming into these topics into this discipline on the undergraduate level when the first link to you have to do is to build your understanding build your background build your expertise in a particular discipline in subject in that discipline then in of course in this paper when you have built your expertise in your knowledge in this particular subject youre going to be demonstrating that knowledge demonstrating that expertise to your professor because this is a college assignment but you know the real purpose of a literature review is it’s a reader service it something you doing as a favor for your readers what are you doing you are bringing them up to date what’s the first thing you and that old friend do you ask each other hey what you been doing all these years fill me in update me you doing the same thing in a literature review you feeling them in you updating them by bringing them up to date then you can start at the present again you see what i’m saying you can bring them along that timeline of the path letting them know the key element the major concepts the key element in your life and what you dare boom then you can start and that the dividing line between the literatures review in the rest of your paper the development you go all their ideas past scholars the past researchers boom and then come your idea,0

love how this little kid acts like hes fully grown but doesnt realize how bad this situation couldve turned they act like they understand the real world but they dont,0
youre a legend its absolutely ridiculous that children can steal scooters a lot of negligence behind the parents side,0
gad damn kid gon become an origami artist he folded that story like 500 times,0
why did you tell them i took your scooter because you did face of extreme anger,0
bro the way he got so angry when his friend told the truth lmao,0
imagine being a resistance member in 1940s and youre able to kill a higher rank member of germany just to have some dude fly in the air and yell at you for rdm,0
i cannot imagine how pathetic someone has to be to want to roleplay as a failed states police lmao,0
why am i being arrested this is a free country jewish man in 1942 germany,0
“you’re not allowed to counter superior forces there’s too many reich officials here” isn’t that what the resistance did lmao,0
the guy who shot the officers trying to arrest them is a total chad,0
scott literally killed them and won and then they drag him back it’s like kids who used force fields when playing army at school wow how the fuck did this get so many likes i guess y’all had a lot of goobers in your school too,0
you cant attack a more powerful force as a resistance member tell that to the taliban buddy,0

jane sounds like the kind of person you dont want to have a conversation with everything would be turned into race ,0
jane was so but hurt over disrespecting a brother ,0
i like how jane thought she was some hero in the call when everyone just looked at her with embarassment it was so bad that even subtrist got out of character,0
that racist jane was so hilarious disrespecting a brother lmao you disrespected the brother,0
twitter creating a safer environment for people to freely express themselves in pxrge freely expresses himself twitter you werent supposed to do that,0
to the one who said stop crying and men can’t show emotion if we’re gonna follow stereotypes like that then get in the kitchen and cook,0
i hate when these feminists talk about how men dont know how to be gentlemen anymore even though whenever we try to be gentlemen we get called simps its not that we dont know how its that we arent allowed to be gentlemen anymore,0
still cant believe you got james to stop talking,0
this is so immature but for some reason it’s so entertaining probably because it’s so incredibly easy to avoid trolls like this and these people get so mad rather than just handle it,0
james and lucy are hilarious the way he turns and menacingly stares into the camera and goes “get out” and then lucy going “there is something wrong with your computer you have a computer virus”,0
james is one of the most terrifying people ive ever seen on zoom,0
man i really wish we had more polite people like james,0
just because your bald doesnt mean you have to be mad at everyone,0
“i don’t mean to punch you in the face here and absolutely break ur skull”  lol,0

the scariest part of this video is skeppy leaving all those floating trees,0
andrew tate is like that uncle that thinks hes giving really good deep advice but in reality hes had a series of broken marriages his kids got taken into foster care and he refuses to believe hes got a drinking and gambling problem,0
im sorry but the way he said youre poor took me out i was not expecting to cackle the way i did at that lol,0
its scary to know he is actually being serious you would honestly think this was a character he had made up ,0
i hate to say it and i hope i don’t sound ridiculous but i don’t know who this man is i mean he could be walking down the street and i wouldn’t know a thing sorry to this man,0
the fact that he gave himself a full head of hair in a fantasy story of himself can never be not funny to me lmao,0
i cant believe his reaction at the end it got weird  100k likes,0
absorber “wha i don’t even know your name” 13 kid “my name’s tarnel barqueesh” wha,0
i don’t know why y’all didn’t see that coming he literally had a sugar daddy,0
as somebody who despises my little pony i approve of this video,0
i got a bad feeling about jay doing experiments next thing you know he creates some kinda scp pony,0
it would be nice to see a more intricate trolling video where you’ve been attending regular meetings and become a regular just to fuck it up or you host a meeting yourself and kick people for dumb reasons and get reactions ,0
i don’t know how clive has been so patient with sub after all these years,0
bro when that lady hyped up kendrick’s new album i almost died  she does not strike me as the type to listen to kdot,0
5744 maybe the hardest ive ever laughed,0

“yo joe your grandma is big as shit” got me dying,0
imagine being a jet griefer not knowing the chernobogs capabilities,0
drop one thats half an hour long putther upload one where youre killing griefers in many ways from riding the train to using vehicles you dont normally use to trolling ,0
i get why people would get annoyed if they were zoom bombed but it was ridiculous how ss was accusing yll of being immature and childlike while she was talking like some 9 year old diva,0
the way she just said okay after you told her no promoting,0
shes the type of person who puts a makeup on her forehead to make up her mind,0
that first woman literally looked insane,0
i love seeing these children get so mad over their precious rp server rules getting broken shit kills me,0
ive waited for so long to see you guys troll people with a tow truck lol,0

the guys screams for help when the boats spawned had me dead,0
who has a more annoying voice lucas or omrilol,0
this is traumatizing and im here for it,0
theres a chance that half of the viewers of this video probably dont even know some of the nextbots origins,0
“you are being transphobic” ugh these people are absolutely insufferable these people actually willingly surround themselves with other people like this,0
as a woman his argument is completely valid it takes two to tango and if one member gets pregnant then they both have to discuss further progress you cant just get pregnant with someones child and go off and abort unless is was an assault situation in which the woman has absolute control of what comes next because thats a horribly traumatic event the woman has to go over proceedings with the man,0
as a member of the nico community we need to get rid of her,0
if anything i feel bad for nico being so paranoid and insecure that she automatically assumes everyone is harassing her regardless of whats being said even someone with the same name was enough to make her feel threatened must be so draining you know no wonder she sounds like shes always on the verge of tears shes also a discord mod so no surprise there i hope she gets the help she needs,0
calling someone “racist” or “phobic” with no evidence to back it up shows true ignorance,0
joe your grandma big as shit dawg had me dying,0
why does derrick have a pad on his forehead ,0
that woman having a mask on on an online meeting is one of the most ridiculous things ive seen in a while what does she think shell get out of it,0

wish soup would start his own lobby become admin cause chaos and then just wait for them to call an adminhim,0
thanks for this owen watching this guy lose his poop constantly on one hand is entertaining but he is doing real damage to unsuspecting people who have fallen for his rhetoric as a christian people like him make the saner ones among us cringe constantly i do not expect everyone to believe but we all have to live together and need to treat everyone with dignity human kindness there is no place in our society for this kind of hate,0
i have to admit this is hilarious however its also sad the fact that theres a remote possibility of this guy or anyone for that matter truly believing in this crap is disheartening and makes me lose faith in humanity really sets us back a few hundred years also if the devil were real this guy would undoubtedly be doing his bidding and not that of any loving god by preaching hate and encouraging division amongst people,0
as an actual witch i find it absolutely hilarious that this “burning service” of his resembled a ritual in almost every way,0
this is obviously terrifying but can we just take a moment to appreciate the fact that he is attempting to cleanse objects of negative energy with the element fire thats legit one of the witchiest acts of witchcraft out there lmao,0
as someone who got away from an unknown prophetess who shared a similar view its scary that he actually has a following while it is hilarious and admirable someone trolled their book burning i find it scary since that only served to strengthen and prove him right in his mind and in his following im just scared if they actually start to become dangerous to that man and us its a trolling joke but to those people and greg its real and not a game,0
dude the british kid went from an annoying kid to an absolute chad in the span of a few minutes honestly props to him for trolling with soup,0
dude that little damn british kid killed me with the nerve endings thing ,0

the sponsor for todays allergy testing roleplay is something im allergic to,0

the worst part is you spent so much time making an incredible deep and intricate lore that is intertwined thru hundreds of videos and i dont think ive stayed awake thru even 10 of the videos ive watched,0
this woman is one of the few asmr tists who got exactly the concept and mastered the practice some asmrtists as fine as they are do not have the sensibility to sometimes avoid some triggers or noises that can actually bother the most sensitive listeners there are patterns of sounds which means some sounds will cause relaxation other sounds might bother one same person and many youtubers dont realize that these cannot be mixed me for an example hate very high pitched noises hate plastic and eating sounds latte could never have a disturbing plastic noise on her videos she just knows whats up,0
c’est incroyable de faire des vidéos d’une qualité folle tous les jours merci à toi de m’endormir tous les soirs bonne nuit à tous,0
completely honest im jealous that she can eat all this junk food and stay in shape one night of me having sweets and i have a food baby already,0
who’s here laying in bed watching while hungry asf,0
erin they bite you they bite you me is relaxed and sleepy asmr is weird sometimes,0
the version we did as kids where i live was honestly a bit weird the direct translation would be three knives to the back blood runs down spiders crawling in your hair snakes round your neck crack an egg on your head and the yolk runs down and then youd usually say boo or something maybe lightly push the person as youre saying it too so yea pretty hardcore for a bunch of 6 year olds lol,0
“there’s an egg on your head and the yolk is running down … there’s a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down” “i’m sleeping with pam’s mom sometimes dinner”,0

‘i realise that i’m much too late and you deserve someone better’ that line really gets to me,0
this shit have to go viral,0
i dont know why everyone is disliking the british one for me i think comfort foods means that you can have it all the time whether youre happy sad tired exhausted or energetic personally i dont even like bread and toast but for him it might be his comfort food which he can have it all the time whenever he wants to without even thinking about the preparations to make for a grand food xx,0
does anyone else watches these videos as a torture challenge while youre hungry as hell,0
i know i’m late on this video but it’s absolutely criminal that tennessee’s signature food wasn’t nashville hot chicken considering how big it’s gotten,0
im from tennessee and frankly im quite disappointed yall put memphis ribs over nashville hot chicken its literally our staple food at this point considering how big hot chicken has gotten,0
when a british person say its the real deal it puts a little fear in our little indian heart  if you dont get this you need a history lesson,0
i love how brutal the commentary is in this one its about time somebody puts dominos in its place i never really understood why people like them so much but to each their own i guess its just too bad they have no appreciation on what qualifies as food worth paying for btw nikhil is so funny i hope you have him on more often,0
i have wanted to visit india forever to experience authentic indian food it’s my favorite cuisine but based on these videos i’m almost tempted to go just to try the indianized version of our crappy american fast food that i never eat in the states the curiosity is kind of killing me now ,0
dominos india have deteriorated a lot over the years their cheese burst doesnt burst anymore stuffed garlic bread doesnt have cheese in it and most importantly they dont use cheese anymore its all vegoil based cheese substitute even their customer care and store staffs are not as good as before i used to love dominos before but now its a nightmare,0
i’m so jealous of all those cool vegetarian options,0
nikhil is pretty funny “chicken maximus which sounds like a roman emperor who is also a coward”…because he’s “chicken”,0
as a mexican its hard to imagine burning the rice on purpose ,0
me as a canadian colorado fries man im so jealous sonny people in canada are jealous me ,0
when street food is more expensive than in a restaurant you know youre in america,0
do you ever eat with your hands never indians pakistaniessri lankans or any desi pal pathetic,0
i had a professor from india and every time the department would order catering he would complain about the vegetarian option with good reason it looked nowhere near as good as the vegetarian option in india,0
ive hated calzone until the day i made it by myself at home every time i tried calzone in a fast food restaurant the filling was like boiled inside and just blah i dont like it this way stopped ordering started cooking it,0

the pizza planet pizza being awful is just disney sticking to the bit since in universe its basically chuck e cheese,0
lol omfg all this time i also thought lotteria was korean my bad,0
so apparently the japanese 7elevens are like mini togo restaurants while the ones in the us serve packaged processed food or reheated frozen processed garbage its almost an insult to call them the same store how do we let them get away with this crap here,0
theres no comparison between us 7 elevens and the 711 in asia dramatic difference on quality of food and service for ppl who live in the us and want to experience the asia 711s go to hawaii 711s are run by different companies in asia which explains the significant difference as an american i barely go to 711 except if i need a drink food is mostly unedible unless ur drunk high or dont care,0
me as a european am always so surprised about the drink sizes in the us how can the smallest soda be 651ml that would in the netherlands be enough for the entire family i mean in japan they have 1l and 15 liter packages but they are clearly to pour in glasses and share they arent portion sized,0
mooshelle was really sucking it in for that fancy pants dance with chase,0
at this point we need an episode of what link eats in a week… because i’m convinced he doesn’t eat anything with flavor or seasonings… like a toddler…,0
whack that like button and i won’t fire manny today,0

attention food wishers scam alert i have no other account names on youtube and do not offer any prizes or special deals unless the message is from this account its not me do not fall for scams by people using a similar name thank you,0

yes im starving yes im sleepy yes its my choice if i wanna sleep but im fasting dude,0
the gov’t must order her to stop the sale of this immediately especially if it’s that perishable and not shipped properly,0
the fact that she doesnt even know what fda stands for along with how its all packaged the list could go on shows that this is obviously not safe,0
im honestly quite confused why she hasnt been taken to court yet she has a nutrition facts that make no sense,0
in ww2 when the americans liberated the concentration camp saintcyprien located in france the american troops wanted to feed the newly freed camp prisoners because they have been starving without knowing what would happen if they would feed them heavy food literally seconds after liberating them the soldiers thinking it was the right thing started giving the prisoners apples sandwiches and even chocolates leading to a lot of prisoners dying after that incident the science team gave out an order to not feed the prisoners in the camps and to let the medical staff feed them first it was mostly a slow input of light soup,0
there’s a story on youtube about a crew of japanese sailors who shipwrecked on an island and went a few weeks without food they were eventually rescued by an american ship and the captain was extremely strict with what the starving crew ate making sure they only ate small amounts of soup ship captains in the 1800’s clearly knew how to deal with starvation and it goes to show how easily knowledge can be lost,0
one could say gordans food is to die for,0
my grandmother told me this story were from the philippines and during the end of wwii during and at the exit of the japanese occupation the us military started to air drop supplies to the civilians including food one of my grandmothers neighbors a young boy picked up a can of corned beef and ate it straight from opening the box of supplies he dropped dead moments after at the time my grandmother thought he died from choking to death but later realized it must have been refeeding syndrome,0
1315 just a quick correction there jimmy did do it for the content but he stated in the comments it was also because he has crohns disease which means he has a nasty amount of gut inflammation he wanted to know if fasting would help with the inflammation,0
i was in a pretty bad accident when i was younger spent about 3 weeks in icu hooked up to a nutrients iv and could only drink water with a straw while stuck in bed i still remember the first time i tried to eat solid food after that it was a little microwave kraft dinner cup i took one bite and immediately was hit with a wave of nausea to the point and nearly vomited right there in my hospital bed i havent really been able to eat plain kd since then,0
so did he hate it its strange that we didnt see him comment on it like he usually does,0
how come guy didnt comment on the food,0
my mexican mom serves me a plate of spicy food me takes a bite this is spicy my mom wdym it’s not spicy also my mom does not react to the food,0
when my youngest sister was about a month or so away from having her first child i told her that the hospital takes the placenta and will make something like spaghetti or lasagna and thats the first meal after her baby was born she kinda freaked out when they brought her a bowl of spaghetti im such a mean brother ,0
i only watch asmr when im hungry so im just torturing myself like that,0

im sorry but songbyrds husband really creeps me out lol and foodie beauty really sitting there passing gas and not caring how disgusting can you be no manners or self respect anyways i love your videos  god bless ,0
im sure foodie beauty is a lovely person foodie beauty is racist and xenophobic,0
i dont understand how people can just fart while having a meal and just move on,0
no foodie beauty is a horrible human,0
foodie beauty is actually a terrible person … and context behind that video is her “cheat meal” was at 5am while her boyfriend at the time got woken up by her and had to get ready she had eaten a salad and cottage cheese the night before i believe and while yes she ate it it wasn’t fulfilling so she at this prebreakfast she genuinely is vile iykyk,0
we filipinos eat with our hands on some occasions and if we know how because not everyone does but there are limitations in what we can eat with our hands the idea of mushing mac and cheese between my fingers already make me squirm and it feels so wrong its like using chopsticks on spaghetti,0
dont click this if youre a kid,0
theres something so disturbing about crystal and chuck other than neglecting evan,0
smh she has so much food aggression she could stand to share a raggedy fry there is no way id get an attitude with my husband over a fry,0
i remember when i tried to swallow a cheese stick whole damn near choked on the cheese i thought it was the end  that being said ill never understand why crystal eatsraces like that with all the chewing difficulties she has ,0
now i’m positive that ketchup packet has been all over the floor and she’s just lickin all over it ,0
you can tell crystal doesn’t have a life cause of how happy or mad she gets over the food races lmao,0
funny enough mukbangers claim viewers “love to hear smacking” yet any comments i read contain complete disdain for the sound never “loved all the loud openmouthed heavy breathing is this vid” ,0
why i disappeared,0
when he took his hiatus i genuinely thought that nick was gonna finally take care of his health its a shame to see that nothings changed,0
you cant help someone who refuses to help themselves,0

my binge eating issues have been horrible lately i totally relate candy ,0
candy if you are experiencing vaginal bleeding after menopause it is not normal it could be a sign of among other things endometrialuterine or cervical cancer get to the doctor now it could also be a sign of less serious things like fibroids polyps hormonal imbalances,0
hearing what you said made me sad never think your worthless believe in yourself never let the opinions of others stop you or bring you down i suffer mental health issues and i feel this way about myself alot i hate seeing other people feeling the same because i know how bad it feels i pray you find strength in yourself x,0

that cut from pams horrified expression at michaels doll scenario to the crossing the line video is so fantastically timedit kills me every time,0
the sad part is when askellad asked thors to be their leader he was actually serious but as he realized it was impossible he had to laugh it off to save face in front of his men,0
thorfinn screaming his lungs out saying he’s going to kill them gives me the biggest chills because you can hear all the pain in his voice but at the same time you can hear how serious he is  i can’t want to see how he will accomplish this ,0
i only lost cause tyrone was looking like his whole face was gonna explode holding that in,0
i have a 22 year old son he has had two falling outs in his life both times they cussed each other took a little time apart and eventually made up and became bros again i have a 17 year old daughter ive lost count of her falling outs and those girls are dead to her half the women my wife considers friends she comes home from hanging out with them and just rags them to obliteration to me,0
we brought you into this world nope my mother did and i respect her for this but i refuse to respect someone based on their gender or race or anything else other than your behaviour and character,0
speaking only from my experience as a 40 year old man most of the guys i knew in highschool are all still friends pretty much all the girls hate each other two women will stare daggers at each other because the other one wore the same color as her two guys can get into a fist fight and if the right song comes on the jukebox they become best friends and spend the rest of the night drinking and talking about music,0
okay this gonna be a long one sorry about that im french and theres an interesting fact about france its that we are brutally honest most other people dont like that so we are called arrogant rude obnoxious but we are not we are just honest and people dont like honesty when we are considered high in the list of nations where spouses cheat on each other its not because we cheat more than you its just because we honestly answered the questions youre probably wondering where im going with that well i was reading all the coments about women being mean to each other not staying friends with each other yadayadayada and i cant relate at all because it doesnt work like that here i still know a lot of female who were already friend in high school and im 40 whenever i see my mother or my girlfriend or my girl friends they are just friendly i dunno its probably only on screen but the number of time i saw in tv shows or movies a group of girls being friendly then as soon as one leave they all turn to bitch on this one thats something i never saw in france they bitch on her while she is here and she doesnt take it badly because she does the same so i was wondering why is that why are they still friends if its different for others then i realized because we are honest my female friends wont hesitate to look at each others and say wow girl you look like shit today didnt you put on weight recently maybe you should work out and for me thats a healthy relationship why does american males manage to stay friends because they trash talk each other because they are honest because they say things as they are yeah sometimes we have fallouts but we mend things why cant female american stay friends because they are sneaky they lie ooooh you look gorgeous girl you are so strong i envy you while not thinking any of that sooner or later in any relationship based on lie the truth will come out and its not going to be pretty,0
this movie was tricky with the amount of swearing in it youtube kept restricting it as 18 and blocked in some countriesterritories so i had to mute all the f words so that everyone can have access to the video,0
as insane as walter is he was correct about the kidnappers being amateurs and the toe belonging to someone else,0
the fact that walter practically causes half the film’s problems yet it turns out in the end not to mention for all for the wrong reasons he was right about everything,0
michelle its a privilege to fly with maverick ellie tell that to his dad legit spat tea choked at that one re mavs f18 being unable to fly again after his demo pulling gs damages the structure of aircraft too many gs will break the airframe immediately but even pulling less than that limit will still do damage microscopic cracks that build up over time invisibly weaking the airframe until it breaks sometimes during normal nonextreme flying to combat this all aircraft have a rated glife that is the maximum cumulative number of gs they can pull in their lives before theyre retired as a precautionary measure mavs extreme maneuvers during the demo may not have broken his f18 immediately but they may have used up so much of its glife that its effectively scrap anyway,0
ive been waiting for this one since you did the first im so conflicted i spent most of my life using top gun as an example that not all great movies need a sequel then the bastards made one and then they added insult to injury by making it so fucking good lol,0
the way bischoff sold and got hit with edgrs spear honestly looks like he died especially when it looked like he hit his head on the bottom turnbuckle,0
ned stark would have never ever sent one of his daughters to do foolishness like that and it makes me miss him yet again,0
my theory here that plant creature could possibly be that fungus but in a more mutated form as seen previously in the missing persons and autopsy report videos whenever someone dies in the backrooms they get covered in this black coloured fungus this fungus is said to be growing and feeding itself onto the person it has attached itself onto mutating itself onto the dead body given that how it takes a long time for certain funguses to mutate 100 1000 or even millions of years at best and also given that how time passes strangely in the backrooms as seen by the researcher who was in the informational video with the date 291990 looked as if he teleported when that strange bizarre flash appeared and his other group researchers vanished however it wasnt teleportation but instead time travel that researcher was all of a sudden sent to the future a couple of months ahead as it was shown in the presentation video with the date 581990 when the alarm rang out and cctv footage showing us the same researcher guy who by some miracle made it back to the entry gate point artificially created by async so by this logic the whenever someone dies in the backrooms the fungus on the dead body has already reached the mutation stage in a short amount of time the creature in this found footage has to be the driver who died in the car crash as seen in kanes secret video of 9780415263573 this car travelling at a really high speed on a highway suddenly no clipped through the road and due to the high speed the driver wasnt able to push the brakes in time to stop the car thus it crashed into the wall as seen in the footage the driver who was still alive at the time but badly injured seemed to have crawled his way to the room where this teenage girl encountered the creature and possibly bled to death there the fungus grew on him and later the entire room in its mutated form also it sounded like the creature was yelling out help in a distorted sound possible the last words of the driver before his death in that room which was seen in the original found footage video and later the pitfalls video that this creature seems to mimic the sounds of its last victims and in this case even its originator which is the driver its all just a theory which i just came up with dont take it canon lol,0
imagine all the friends and family who went missing without a trace ended up in the backrooms,0
fun fact the reason why the f35 fighter that maverick mentions when hes briefed on the target is not the ideal candidate for the mission is because of the gps jamming in actuality behind the scenes the f35 didnt have room in the cockpit for the cameras that they outfitted in the f18s they needed to have the actors ride backseat with real pilots in order to film the flight sequences and the f35 couldnt accommodate that,0
poor viserys hes a good dude but he suffers the human flaw that almost everyone suffers hes adverse to hearing harsh truths about himself even from his own brother,0
when viserys was talking about the winter coming danys theme was also playing it was so sad ,0
targaryans have prophetic dreams called dragon dreams however as maester aemon said i see them in my dreams sam i see a red star bleeding in the sky i still remember red i see their shadows on the snow hear the crack of leathern wings feel their hot breath my brothers dreamed of dragons too and their dreams killed them every one the grief and glory of house targaryen,0
daemon is being made a lot more nuanced than he was in fire and blood the “heir for a day” brothel scene really makes me question him we saw that he’s not enjoying himself at all despite frequenting brothels before and renting this one out specifically to celebrate the gold cloaks’ accomplishments with the boys mysaria seems to be an enabling force goading him into his darker tendencies when he says “we must all grieve in our own ways” i think he actually was somewhat saddened by baelon’s and aemma’s death daemon does want power but he does love his brother “over the centuries house targaryen has produced both great men and monsters prince daemon was both in his day there was not a man so admired so beloved and so reviled in all westeros he was made of light and darkness in equal parts to some he was a hero to others the blackest of villains” archmaester gyldayn,0
that childbirth scene was gruesome the screams affected me just as much as shireen’s burning at the stake,0
targaryans have a history of putting a lot of stock in their dreams the only reasons the house survived the doom of valyria is because one of them had a dream it would happen and they packed up and went to dragonstone even in game of thrones dany had a dream about stepping into the fire that hatched her eggs thats why she did it this is the problem with watching this show and criticizing certain characters without having any book context at all,0
my underestanding is that the wife wasnt going to survive either way so it was a matter of letting the gods take them both or actively killing his wife to save the baby an absolutely terribly choice especially given how she would have to go through it weve seen some horrible stuff but her death scene was up there with one of ramsays scenes i also think given recent political events in the us it was very timely without being an overt political statement like we might see from marvel not to mention it was the pivotal moment that sets the stage for everything to come also i hear this series will be far more morally grey than game of thrones ever was daemon gives me ramsay or joffrey vibes but hell be much more complex and less villainous while he seems to operate on selfmotivation his violence isnt wanton or random like joffrey or ramsay so i picture him being closer to a cerseijaime style character but if anything he absolutely gives peak targaryen vibes and matt smith gives a stellar performance im really excited to see corlys valaryon and rhaenys targaryen a shame we havent seen much of rhaenys but i picture her having some of cerseis chip on her shoulder for being snubbed the crown i hate to touch on this but i know corlyss racial change was of concern and i originally had slight concern myself not because some omg woke bs but because of the velaryons and the targaryens are supposed to be basically siblings in relation so i prefer representation coming from a new source rather than an existing one but if you think about it the light complexion of the targaryens is much more of an oddity given their geographic origins furthermore valyria was awfully close to the summer isles and sothoryos so to me corlys is more what i would envision the original valyrians would look like so it doesnt bother me in the slightest especially after seeing him on screen he seems like a great character already and i think and hope hes up there with davos otto hightower gives strong tywin and littlefinger vibes prioritizing family image and political opportunity above all he does seem like a type of manofhonor but more in the sense of being a strict rulefollower stuck in the old ways and then obviously viserys is the ned stark of the series i love seeing that name reclaimed and while the timing was bad and perhaps more of necessity im glad he apologized to rhaenerys and shows a lot of faith in her i especially like that when brought up with the council the first response was theres never been a queen but one of the others was quick to chime in with only out of precedent and tradition its nice to see them consider it rather than the whole group quickly dismissing it has hah but shes a woman maybe rhaenys serves as a reminder of what they could have had also while the age difference between him and alicent is a little insane and i dont like otto pimping out his daughter like that i do think they would legitimately treat each other well probably erring on the side of viserys being distant with her because he misses his wife and is traumatized by her passing and the part he played in it most of all the show felt like we jumped straight into s3 or s4 of game of thrones,0
137 im turkish but the man speaks so fast that i couldnt understand my native language ,0

watching doflamingo’s speech after reverie is even crazier ,0
its worth noting that laws plan was to destroy the smile factory to get kaido mad at doflamingo so doflamingo and kaido would end up fighting each other taking down doflamingo themselves wasnt part of the plan,0
sad to see that in the name of entertainment we are spending so much on theater tickets that these actors are demanding 25 crores for a movie even highly educated proffesionals cas engineers doctors civil servants etc do not earn this kind of money in india after 10 year of service a simple logic if theses actors including the kumars khans devgans kapoors roshans etc start charging 10 to 50 lac per movie the theater ticket price will drop automatically and eventually we can start enjoying movie in the theaters with our families at a much lesser price these superstars have built their mansions worth 100 crores and secured the lifes of their children and grandchildren they are living kingsize life with our hard earned money i believe we better stick to ott or any other form of free entertainment which is easily available on youtube or any other app,0
1932 thats what you got from daemons smile how are everyone giving daemon villain tag so quickly it feels like i saw some other episode and many other people saw another it felt more like my brother knows me hes right these other idiots know nothing smile daemon is vicious and acts douchy but also cares about his family from the scenes before with rhaenyra at the funeral,0
after the foul taste the original got left in my mouth i didnt have very high hopes for this yet i watched it and it honestly feels like the earlier seasons maybe not quite there yet but definitely enough to have me hooked and wanting more of it i find it hard to pinpoint daemon on the one hand he wants to show strength the city watch part but then hes also arrogant the tournament claiming victory while the fight wasnt over and straight up horrible heir for a day but on the other hand he really cares for rhaenyra and at the funeral he told her her father would need him more now than ever before which shows he also cares for viserys i think him calling viserys weak was his blunt way of telling viserys to watch out for those at the council and act like a king which is in line with what he did with the city watch he feels like the king should show his strength viserys seems like hes held things together for those 9 years but this clearly is coming to an end i feel like hes made a huge mistake by alienating daemon this wont make things easy for rhaenyra who already has to fight the fact that some people dont want a woman on the throne in the end i think it will be between those two and viserys will be long gone from the picture,0
pretty sure that daemon didnt actually say the heir for a day even in the books its implied that otto might have made it up to drive a wedge between the brothers and daemon just didnt want to say anything at that moment he is vile but he has his brothers best intentions in mind for sure,0
he can roast anybody without making them feel bad ,0
fully agree with you regarding that scene where vedha hrithik is smiling devilishly while spraying bullets people have the habit of complaining and most of the people who are complaining they have not even watched the original vv and yes hrithik did not copy amitabh and similarly here he did not copy the great vs,0
in orginal movie and trailer specifically both vikram and vedha were projected to be equals given equal screen time dialogues and actions but here i believe hrithik is being pushed more than saif and thats what bugs me,0

finally i already missed you so the next one is as soon as possible jungkook and jimin are the ones who get hurt the most they always give more than they expect and often get hard on themselves and often exhaustion and fainting just for everyone to see the best of them in every performance it hurts armys to see him this way,0
jungkook and jimin are definitely the ones who push themselves the hardest during performances they are both the ones i noticed who are getting injured or almost passing out and its sad because when their own stage they seem so lively and full of energy and then these documentaries come out and you realize when they went back stage they were suffering jungkook has gotten injured multiple times hes almost fainted a lot of times there was this one award show they went to and jungkooks hands were literally shaking and he fainted multiple times or came close to it i of course worry about all the members but i always worry the most for jimin jk because we know how much they would put a performance and entertaining army above their health sometimes,0
remember all the deleted and bonus episodes a chapter is not actually over until you watch them maybe you didn’t know i really like to watch you react to rise of bangtan but it’s beginning to seem a bit weird to me that you don’t finish a chapter until moving on your reactions always seems genuine but it has made me question wether you actually want to continue this series it’s fair id you don’t this is just so weird sorry,0

i remember two years ago staying up at 3 in the morning with a cup of anxiety just to listen to the 3 am study session premiere at 144p using limited data on my half cracked phone wondering where ill be in the future and if things will go well for me after i graduate now here i am once again at 3 in the morning with a cup of coffee fast internet and my own custom pc it took a lot to get here and i still have a long way to go in life and have uncertainties for my future but for anyone out there who have worries or anxieties for their next few years just know that if i could make it than so can you i hope you will get to experience the same bliss i have at the moment as we often forget to enjoy just today when we keep thinking about the tomorrows and thank you chilledcow for being there during the moments edit i just want to say i appreciate everyone for all the encouraging likes and messages i wish nothing but the best for all of you who are pulling through your struggles,0

there is a big mistake in this the dazzle camouflage doesnt work to hide the zebra in the grass its designed to make it difficult to judge distance to a target so when the lion goes to attack the zebra he might pounce too soon and when he is in the chase he will find it difficult when to strike out with his claws the same thing was used against submarines,0

i just finished college all these years of schooling have been mostly miserable now i spend a lot of time learning things on youtube for fun and out of curiosity,0
the sad thing is this was posted 7 years ago and nothing has changed in the school system,0
you forgot the most important function of school to make children hate learning,0
we are teaching our children the wrong things in school we are creating a societal system where each section is dependent upon the other sections this means when one section fails then the rest also fail we need to teach our children to be independent instead we teach children how to be obedient workers to give meaning to someones life teach them how to grow their own food build their own house repair their own car cook their own meals eat to stay healthy and most importantly how to meditate and pray this gives life meaning,0
i worked as a high school teacher for thirty years over the years it gradually dawned on me that the many educational theories which were forced on us were based on absolutely nothing but unproven theory learning style was just one of many nearly every year a new style or theory would be introduced nobody ever rigorously challenged these theories presented as facts demanding evidence and proof ever yet if you did not adapt your teaching to incorporate these unproven styles you would be judged to be a failing teacher so you had no choice at least whilst being observed i became quite cynical in the end because i realised the new methods were invented and then promoted by people just trying to further their career with something for their cv and each method would last a year or two before going out of fashion and being replaced by a new one god forbid anyone would actually just leave the teachers to use their own experience education and intelligence,0
im a pressure learner i only learn school material when theres severe stress and doubts about my future imposed on me,0
people learn easier when they are interested and is enjoying to know a topic also if you understand schooling as the obligation of attend to school and have satisfying grades and education as acquire knowledge through studying for self interest it will not only be clearer that we learn only what we want to know but also that several government regulations on schools around the globe is actually making people dumber,0
as someone who grew up doing common core— it just took time away from learning things that were actually useful in class it frustrated the teachers attempting to teach it and it cost the school a lot of money to get all the printed math books and other common core materials for essentially no benefit to the students i can’t recall a single time common core was spoken of positively by the teachers or the other students,0
so we found that the problem wasn’t the education system per se but the circumstances that children grew up in and rather than even entertain the possibility that an inequitable socioeconomic foundation was to blame it was easier to say “kids aren’t learning because there’s something wrong with the books teachers and schools” i love how simple it is to explain so many crappy circumstances through the lens of cognitive dissonance now we’ve graduated to blaming lack of homeownership on people being too indebted as opposed to a dearth of housing options in the places where people actually want to live or more accurately a dearth of places with housing where people actually want to live,0
schools need to push to hold back students instead of pushing them to a level out of their league until they give up the students that are showing much slower growth need to be put into an alternative careerlife focused schoolclassesprogram,0
apologies for not watching the whole video as a former student and a parent of students i know the system was broken long before common core i remember in college my english 1 teacher had to give me a grammar guide because i was so deficient on the basicsthough i did well in english all through school i had to take remedial math because my high school didnt prepare me for college coursesthough i graduated with the required credits things have gone down since i was a student and my kids had schools with very high standards but very low expectations that means there were a lot of advanced classes offeredlike calculusbut so many ways to accept failure they had to take history and social studies but only had to pass one the policy of no child left behind was an additional failure as it meant no one failed or was held back even though they wouldnt graduate on time kids were just left in education limbo until they earned enough credits to be ousted too much government involvement means teachers arent allowed to teach we have some phenomenal teachers who are underpaid with far too much nonteaching responsibility heaped on them schools arent just expected to educate students now theyve got to feed them clothe them teach them manners and how to get along look out for abuse deal with all their special needs and accompanying ieps head off bullying deal with allergies and medical conditions worry about gender identity and sexuality discipline fairly deal with helicopter parents check the boxes for college prep and deal with the everpresent worry over school shootings with all were expecting from schools and teachers its a wonder anyone goes into this profession or stays once they see the outlook common core like no child left behind is a great idea on paper that fails in implementation my kids went to school at a time when the policy was to insure teachers were welleducated there was a push to make them go back to college for additional courses and they were tested themselves on what they were teaching their students it meant even more testing for studentsto judge whether their teachers were up to the task at the same time they removed a lot of incentive for teachers to do betterlike tenure they promoted the best teachers out of the classroom they took away teaching assistants due to the costs they increased class sizes and they started charter schoolswhich were experimental programs imagine if all those billions spent on common core were used to pay teachers moreand get out of their way,0
ive been studying with the traditional academia style from my chidhood and i think this was one of the reasons of my deep unhappiness everytime i had to go to the school and i agree the system can be totally useless when it comes to study died things in only books and not providing experiential oportunities to learn for children its a very serious matter that i hope will dramatically change very soon i adapted to the system and became succesful in the studies but i can tell not in life sharing my experience all the best to you guys,0
my school was too crowded for everyone to flourish i have not seen any change in the last 50 years since i graduated ranked choice voting is much needed now i reeducated my self after i turned 35 it took me 17 years to realize how little they thought me,0
this is soo true but the real situation is even more dull for the sake of the work schools are providing the online classes to the students without considering whether they have or havent necessary access to the resources this malice is pervading in rural regions more abruptly,0
just so were clear army drill sergeants arent allowed to do a lot of this stuff in most countries sleep deprivation and injuries kills actual learning regardless how determined everyone is,0
i used to work for those online tutoring companies they wanted native english speakers and promised you 16 but would dock your pay for things like yawning on screen the pace was insane i was fired for not smiling enough the burnout rate was very very high especially because you had to get up at about 4 am to do it if you lived in america the kids would be really young the youngest i tutored was 3 too young to understand anything at all and be in pajamas and finishing up their dinner so like the last thing they wanted to do was stare at a computer and learn english especially because the age range seemed to be 57yearolds sometimes they would pick up the laptop they were on and just run around the room with it and the parents would give us bad marks for not keeping their child engaged enough it was a really horrible job for both companies i worked for,0
in kenya i experienced the same the kcse is the one exam that can make or break your life i slept for 5 hours a day lessons from 5 am to 8 pm it was stressful the pressure from parents and society is sometimes too much i am glad it is all gone,0
im 17 this year and am studying in an international high school in shenzhen china i was in public school until high school im grateful my parents provided me the opportunity to leave that stressful system but i heard from my former classmates who are in the system that in recent years the pressure on that system has been declining but i cant be assured because im no longer in that system recalling my dark days in that system ive always hated it because there was a lot of transcribing homework and memorizing poems and passages when you fail to remember them teachers will punish you by transcribing the poems and passages several times i understand the reason why our government has such a system because we have such a vast population and i do think its relatively fair even though its fairness is declining especially when this double reduction policy came down,0
ive been an edtech consultant in beijing for 7 years ive also traveled to multiple provinces and smaller tier cities to evaluate and help schools there are multiple compounding factors as to why education is so subpar yet expensive the first and foremost factor i would note is the lack of public discourse this permeates through every part of society especially education if you are discouraged or not allowed to question things and people around you you end up missing a fundamental piece of being a good learner inquiry and reflection in education this comes in the strict form of rote knowledge even in history class theres no critical thinking or reflection involved it just becomes a bunch of facts to remember the second factor of note is barriers of information the public does not have easy access to a lot of internationally recognized academic content and even if they did get access they wouldnt be able to recognize it on top of that there are many misconceptions about education which are exaggerated by big businesses such as vipkids who outright lie to parents about standards and expectations this causes market distortion and other smaller business simply pick a recognizable brand name eg wonders and say thats their curriculum without any plan how to implement it the third factor is incompetence born from lack of actionable knowledge as stated in the first point most of the populations education revolves around rote knowledge and discourages reflection if youve been taught not to question things your whole life how can you be expected to teach others with inquiry based experiences and methodologies how can you be expected to recognize or create effective content to support those learning experiences the result usually ends up being copy pasting something they found online that looks good or fishing consultants like me for free content the fourth factor is lack of foreign talent there are not enough qualified teachers to meet demand the general population would not be able to recognize one either many companies hire russians call them american and slap a 200 markup on the course its up to the unqualified teacher to come up with the content instruction and meet the unrealistic expectations the decision makers sales people set for the parents the final factor is who the decision makers are who decides what national curriculum is starting in 2020 private schools have been forced to throw out foreign curriculum and adopt the national curriculum this topdown decision making only exasperates the situation it also permeates throughout the society ive been the unfortunate soul who has to coordinate curriculum development projects with the decision makers of these schools most of these decision makers are unqualified theyre sales people at best i should also mention that many parents have no clue about education yet influence the schools with their misconceptionsbut this is not the parents fault rather its the schools fault for not being professional enough to know how to manage expectations and implement a program as for price its simply about demand vs supply lack of foreign talent as mentioned before combined with a desperate middle class and higher trying to get their children in schools abroad at any cost they will pay upwards of 200k rmb just to make it happen for their little middle schooler unfortunately i exited the market partially because the clients i had to deal with were frustratingly incompetent and unwilling to address problemsmostly because the government outright banned foreign curriculum,0
the problem i have with those overly stressful education systems is that i wonder if they actually work and if the students learn effectively through them what i learned through selfdefense practice and military documentaries is that stress and anxiety seem to decrease your ability to focus and are not an effective way to learn in selfdefense instructors increase stress by making you do cardiobased exercises to make your body artificially feel stress accelerated heartbeat difficulty to breath difficulty to focus only to test your ability to reproduce the technique properly when your focus is the least optimal but they dont do it for learning purposes the military seems to do it too in their own way i would also point out that every doctor in the world with common sense would tell you that there is a considerable difference between the way we think we perform under fatigue and the way we actually perform under fatigue its funny how the little girl in the video who had an allegedly stressfree education in kindergarten was able to catch up with her classmates in a few months i wonder how the students who went through this type of education system would perform against students from other countries here in france we dont have that type of education system nor in the united kingdom i studied for 2 years at a british university,0
i never really agreed with this kind of education system i live in malaysia my earliest childhood memories were ever only filled with tuitions left and right no play until you finish your homework if you fail to memorise spellings you will be punished back then i never really thought much of it but now that i’m in college being exposed to a more western type of education system made me question this kind of practice it never helpd me improve my academic i was always dead last in class all it ever did to me was lowering my self confidence and give me anxiety im never going back to those times,0
when i was a kid back in 76 my teachers took away my cassette recorder they never gave it back the song i played was this one,0
my teacher hates this song,0
stocks wavered thursday as traders awaited friday’s july jobs report which will give the latest snapshot on the labor market and the health of the economy with inflation currently at about 10 my primary concern is how to grow my reserve of 300k which has been sitting duck since forever with zero to no gains sure im all in on the long term game but with my savings are lying waste to inflation and my portfolio losing gains everyday i need a remedy asap,0
im watching in 2020 10 years later and i feel like theres still no change,0
i certainly remember being much better at being creative when i was younger but now that im a freshman in high school ive noticed that im much worse at the whole creativity thing now the problem is im being praised why i am great at finding the one answer i can take tests very well but am typically not the best at projects math is my best subject english is my worst where you typically have to write creative essays i want to be an engineer so at my school we have an elective called preengineering its one of the closest classes to an actual job thats available at my school and im not the best at it sure i can do the math required but coming up with ideas for better designs is hard i feel that this shows that my education is doing the opposite of preparing me for the future its telling me that theres one answer which is never the case in engineering i hope that soon enough we can have an education overhaul and realize that we need to change education,0
guy has an existential crisis whilst speedrunning a popular game altered for educational purposes,0
in bedrock sometimes portals are just that hard to find i remember blowing up a stronghold for like an hour then finally finding the portal,0
just in case you didnt know bedrock edition has a chance of not having a portal room this makes it really hard for speedrunners to use bedrock because if they get to the strong hold in just 10 minutes it might not even have a portal room,0
i used to write so well and elaborate descriptions were super easy my pen flowed on paper like butter but ever since my teacher screamed at me for exceeding the word limit in the exam i got so discouraged that i gave up on writing and now i cant even write a simple essay school really does kill creativity dont let that happen to you,0
these creative children have turned into these teenagers who are unwilling to think outside the box im only 13 and i felt that in my soul,0
education is when you learn from your mistakes school is where you get mocked for your mistakes,0
everyone is intelligent but our grades made us idiots jabin baret 2021,0
what parents expect from us during school constant straight a’s good social life all that what they don’t expect stress depression social awkwardness school just sucks having to determine all self worth on a high or low grade just makes you upset and then fear what happens as a consequence i hate how parents don’t understand that school can genuinely give a child depression and mental health issues because they refuse to think like their child they always say that we aren’t depressed just faking it for attention i had a mental breakdown once all i was asked was why did i cry and that there had to be a reason a person should not have a damn reason to express themselves it’s just bs,0
its true education is a neverending process i feel formal education doesnt teach you to learn from your failures but rather punish you,0
as a 33 year veteran teacher i suggest that you talk to teachers about their working conditions the disrespect has infected the classrooms teachers are being verbally and physically attacked by students and even parents on a daily basis a lot of this stems from mental health issues yet nothing is ever done about it,0
low wages harassment bullying karens lack of security respect paperwork working conditions pay safety updated and fact based books etc plus who the heck wants to worry about being murdered at their job not having security taken seriously by those in charge this will never happen at are school attitude,0
its hardly surprising even in rich districts teachers are underpaid undervalued and overworked they are expected to take on more responsibilities every year with fewer and fewer resources all while administrators ignore their pleas and parents treat them like overqualified babysitters my wife quit teaching several years ago she was working 67 days a week and spending hundreds of dollars a month on supplies just to keep her classroom running and the school gave her absolutely no support with unruly students,0
respect for teachers is not just about the salary although an increase in salary is sorely needed teacher pay has always been lower than other professions with the same education and experience its also about respect for the profession student behavior in my view can be linked to the disrespect for teachers theyre seeing parents administrators and politicians demonstrate hiring a person trained as a soldier to teach is very disrespectful to the profession as a teacher i dont feel qualified to do the job of a soldier i respect the profession too much the anybody can teach attitude is not only insulting its ignorant,0
who wants to get shot in the classroom while trying to protect these disrespectful students who cuss you out on a daily basis,0
i was raised in a teaching family when the profession was respected and teacher strikes unheard of fast forward to a major university where teaching majors walk away from the profession after their first classroom experiences why would any sane person want to be in a job when they are disrespected or not trusted so much,0
decades of we need to cut the education budget created an environment where supplies are now being provided at cost to the teachers larger classes low respect with more flak being thrown their way this year due to bs rhetoric denigration from political grand standers and then pile on top this push for parents wanting to directly interfere in the teachers professional conduct you have caused the great resignation of teachers own up to it and fix your funding priorities,0
so it turns out that if you underpay and undervalue teachers nobody wants to be a teacher huh go figure,0
the cost of education in this country is crazy if we want to have an educated workforce we need more affordable education,0
here we are in the 20th century in the usa and education is a luxury something is very wrong with this picture thank you bernie for your deft combination of common sense and wisdom,0
stop funding wars and start funding education and health care its taxpayer money let we the people vote on how to spend it,0
its outrageous that union organizers are excluded from the debt forgiveness program sounds like something the republicans and corporate dems would have agreed to include in the bill,0
so sad why are federal student loan interest rates so high we need workers with skills in this country my husband died at 66 and his one wish was to pay off our daughter’s graduate school loan and our daughter in law’s undergraduate loan i did that and now have a new granddaughter we need to lift this burden to help all with this kind of debt,0
as someone whos from md and lives in pa pennsylvania came higher than i expected and maryland was lower baltimore probably dragged maryland down but pa is a surprise thats because pennsylvania schools are funded through a system called school taxes where each of the 500 school districts spread across 67 counties levy their own property taxes to fund their schools thats why someone living next door to you can be paying twice as much in taxes to go to a school half as good this system has been known to disproportionately affect rural and urban school districts and tip in favor of school districts in suburban communities or those in the poconos where they have resorts that people own condos at,0
nothings wrong with going to college its the fact that we are traditionally taught that we all need to go to college to be successful when in fact college isnt for everyone and especially isn’t the only way to succeed in life same people that tell you to go to college are paying debt still from it how the rich stay rich and poor stay poor,0
my son is a senior in high school this year he says he might choose community college but doesnt want a 4 year university trade school is fine too i think he just doesnt know what he wants to do with his life yet and thats okay i went to college and spent 12 years paying it off just to decide later that social work was not for me i dont understand why kids have to rush into a lifelong career when they havent even had the opportunity to live life yet i want my child to explore different career paths before he chooses one im in no rush to kick him out all i ask is that he works or goes to school i dont want him to be out on his own until he has money saved in the bank and a stable job i want him to know how to budget and manage his finances properly i dont want him to struggle living paycheck to paycheck trying to make ends meet he can go to college anytime if he chooses to do so theres no age limit,0
as a millenial i cant help feeling like we were the experiemental group with university somehow how much could colleges charge and get away with how far can they upsell this idea of helping people get better jobs by going in debt for the rest of their lives its ridiculous that celebrating paying off student loans is even a thing in the first place now that the next gen has seen the effects they are only taking logical next steps to ensure their own security universities is just way too expensiveon top of that theres cost of housing and food and transportation if it were more affordable i truly believe more kids absolutely would go but if someone in that position asked me for advice i would always advise them to at least complete community college and 2 year degrees or certification programs at the very least in a practical field many include internships that have great potential to lead to decent jobs,0
when education becomes a business instead of a right this is what happens,0
well lets consider this most nations give free college to their citizens here in the us however we charge them to attend colleges that would make our nation more educated and more adept at highskilled jobs its almost like we want our population to suffer while we are going threw an economic crisis but hey lets ignore that completely right,0

india is a country of a billion people but if anyone ever says that stuff again ask them what is the addressable market for their product and watch the fun ill bet my money 99 of these so called entrepreneurs dont know how big their market actually is thats why they can never convert their company into conglomerates,0
i dont know why people dont watch interviews they are as insightful if not more,0
masters union cannot replace institutions like iim or iit because of the sheer fact that mu does not have to comply with the guidelines of a college or a university indian colleges or universities dont have any place in the top institutes of the world and rightly so but something that an iit or iim has to deal with that none of the other institutes in the world deals with is the implementation of the reservation policy because of the implementation of reservation there is a possibility that a huge chunk of the people who get into iims and iits be lacking in certain core subjects dont assume i am a casteist because i am outlining a drawback in reservation policy i completely support the reservation policy and every caste is now enjoying the benefit of reservation and so the faculty of these institutions have to compensate for this drawback and this becomes a huge stepback in achieving wonderful things within a span of 200 years but the reservation policy gives students from poor and rural backgrounds who havent had access to great education in their schoolscolleges an access to great education when it comes to their higher education but in an institution like masters union going by their fees structure and the absence of any deferral of fees payment or scholarship the students generally come from priveleged backgrounds who have had access to great education since kindergarten while masters union assures great education institutions like iits and iims ensure social equity and great education the entire para is based on my knowledge that there are no reservations in mu,0

even after practicing more than 1600 questions till now im not able to cross the 1300 barrier i have given 5 practice tests till today and my scores are 1350 1310 1250 1310 and 1320 what could be the probable reason according to you please help i really feel frustrated and hopeless now to think that even after practicing so many questions im not able to get a 1400 score edit ive given one attempt and my score was 1310,0
i am getting close to perfect in writing and math but i am getting like anywhere between 37 wrong in reading section constantly wiuthout any real pattern any tips,0
ritesh why are you charging money for your sat notes no bro this is not the way i cant use your notes now,0
guys i need more tips for reading sometimes i get 13 wrong questions and other times i get 22 how do i remain consistent with just 6 days left for sat,0
hi ritesh im a brazilian student ive been studying for the sat like crazy for the past months my goal is a 1500 but im stuck at the 1460 ive scored 1500 a month ago on mock but only 1460 ever since and i feel it is a lot due to my mentalitystress do you recommend anything for me to relax or review so i can actually get a 1500,0
hey man do you have any tips to avoid silly errors i get errors just due to carelessness or not reading the passage thoroughly do you have any tips for that,0
quick question i got a 1380 on a previous official sat i made some stupid math mistakes but killed the english section for the most part can i still clutch up and get that 1400 through a bunch of studying or is that a strechthis is my first sat btw,0
the sat reading section was like torture to me i would get 20 questions wrong all the time but with alot of hard work and dedication i ended up getting a 690 on it you can do this guys,0
here in india even 7th class exam comes harder than this,0
ive taken the sat 3 times the most frustrating part about the sat is that unless youre at an advanced level in math or above the normal level for your grade theres a high chance you wont understand or even recognize over 50 of the material and questions the first time i took it i barely understood a lot of the math on it because i wasnt even completely through algebra 2 long story short i hate standardized testing and i feel as though a lot of kids are set up for failure tt im lucky i got to take it multiple times this year since i understand most of the math now,0
i wanted at least a 1300 that was my goal my minimum i got an 1170 now i’m retaking it senior year but i’m completely dejected i have a couple weeks left i’m really trying to understand things better people are counting on me,0
i wish i wouldve looked for this video a lot sooner the sat is tomorrow for me,0
when youre watching this as a refresher but realize you know nothing,0
just here trying to learn 3 years of math into my head in a weekend before the test on tuesday april 13 2021 we all in the same struggle good luck to who ever reading this on your sat,0
i’m actually kinda nervous cause i’m taking my sat tomorrow and did no studying whatsoever watching this give me some confidence thx,0
not me watching this 8 hours before i take the test,0
to be honest about this whole thing youre right you dont have to study the knowledge you accumulated from 9th to 1112th grade all you have to know are the tricks wealthy people pay just for this to the test and thats the only way possible to get a high score its like a very special system to weed out the people who cant afford to go to college i feel sorry for this because education should be affordable to all,0
the guy who invented sats sounds like the type of kid to remind the teacher about the homework,0
i’m surprised they didn’t mention how you have to pay to take the test seriously it’s one of the most obvious ways of why and how it measures family income over actual intelligence rich people can just take the test more,0
so you’re telling me if this person didn’t had this weird fascination of ranging peoples intelligence into some kind of scalemeter format that i wouldn’t have to stress over sats so much,0
half the comments on this video are “lol you guys think the sat is hard wait til you learn about insert random country’s standardized test” the discussion surrounding this video shouldn’t be “mine is harder and therefore better” it should be about how bad standardized testing is and how it really isn’t a measure of intelligence just of taking the test,0
all these people commenting im poor and i got a 1300 by studying a lot  we are talking about that poor people on average are less likely to get a great score not that its impossible there is a difference between inequality in general and a specific success story,0
“low scores should never be a veto on a student’s life” that hit me hard,0
im worried i cant do my sat on august tt any further more techniques please,0
the biggest problem for me right now is that i’m working during the day i try to study from 7830 am but then i have to catch the bus to go to work at 10 and then i work until 4 but get home at 5 then i have to walk my dogeat dinner and can only start studying at 9 again but i wake up at 6 so it’s so hard to find time,0
how can i get fee waiver for sat exam i complete class 12 in 2020 but not joined any college please say how can i get fee waiver,0
“yeah the sat is unnecessary” everyone proceeds to get 1500’s,0
as fun as these videos are i do want to give a certain amount of warning to hs students just because you have the grades scores letters of rec essays and extracurriculars doesn’t mean you’ll be accepted into these schools i was denied to all of my colleges despite having a 38423 a 1490 and being on a nationally recognised robotics and rocketry team i even did robotics research in hs at a university applied to the university and then was denied from that university so much of it is just an arbitrary lottery it’s hard to truly know,0
i like watching these videos cuz they do be inspiring me to continue my college education in highscool i was a 20 gpa student barely putting the effort to muster a c my only way getting into college was soccer but eventually i quit due to mental health i was really depressed and didn’t have any motivation for anything had no friends no job and overall i was in a bad state in hs i just turned 20 now back in community college trying to get a degree eventually gonna transfer but yeah would’ve wished i had better guidance and wished i could go back and change that so i wouldn’t have made it harder on myself i didn’t even go to prom no football game nothing and overall had no social life starting to change now how i am now and it’s honestly making me a better person and happier seeing you guys so happy at yale is motivation and brings me joy you guys are very smart and i also admire your hard work you put in and the sacrifice,0
update sat subject tests have been discontinued forever sat optional essay section has been removed as well,0
i’m getting really scared for this sat i usually get bs and the sat is my last good way to getting into a good college,0
me watching this getting 1530 sat score in 2019 that i never sent to any school,0
i need help i have math 730 and i really sucked in reading with 430 i dont know how to get 650 a least english is not my first language,0
“the whole sat in general is a waste of time” finally someone said it,0
im just gonna be real with you if a question says delete the underlined portion as one of the choices 910 times deleting is the best option i never see them put that choice but it doesnt fit,0
you know the school system is bad when people are posting how to guess the answer to a question,0
“primary definitions are almost always wrong” me nods and chooses the answer that says blend means to quietly assert,0
i couldn’t do this i’d get anxiety and triple check the passage,0
how the hell you get 2200 out 2400 and end up working at buzzfeed,0
these people all got better scores than me i think the sat shows how well you can take a testnot how well you understand the subject im a terrible test taker,0
no talking during the exam you all failed,0
this is the entire problem with the sat system its not about the knowledge its the tricks in taking the exam things like sat prepping and all other things should not be encourage when taking it in real statistics term the results you get from taking the test are false because youve practice to jacked up your score,0
no way these sat scores were accurate 2300 out of 2400 yea okay someone doesnt know how the scoring works,0
my predictions readingwriting 630680 math 750800 overall 13801480 edit after taking it readingwriting 620660 math 710740 overall 13301400 my results readingwriting 650 math 720 overall 1370 im just going to keep this score i have been studying for over a year now and it’s not going to improve,0
my prediction 790 math i will miss 1 question because i either miscounted squares on a graph or multiplied numbers wrong 740 reading writing i will do something stupid 1530 overall,0
im a junior whos trying to get a 1470 on the sat this year i took it last year and got a 930 i have to study like hell,0
i didn’t even know what the sat was until sophomore year because my parents didn’t know much about how the school system worked here and i’m the oldest so it’s all firsts ,0
watching this as a senior is too late lol  please don’t procrastinate like i did study a lot,0
can we get a video on how a company that sucks so much money out of students is supposed to be nonprofit,0
so 4 mistakes in math takes you down to 710the things people do for money,0
i remember a few years back i got a single question wrong on the psat reading section and it dropped me three points out of the 38 possible explain to me how its not curved,0
the fact that they don’t score on a curve is a completely lie and was contradicted in the video what do u call saying that one test is harder than another so they can get more wrong even if this is true there are so many ways to combat this with still making sure that there is no cheating this is especially true in the math section where y literally have to change numbers because the concepts that you are testing should be the same or relatively similar and even though this may be harder for the english section when it comes to the documents and essay there are still many ways to make sure that there is not too much of a differentiation that it would merit a curve because there is no other word for what ur doing,0
shawn you are correct about what’s going on out here in these churches can’t rely on these pastors they are all about the cash not saving souls most of them are bad,0
i use to be mase sunday school teacher in atlanta when he first got started… he got my home girl number off the membership list and he was dating his secretary at the time… my home girl told me she would be in the tub while talking to him… he asked her… “you want to get to know mase the man or mase the man of god… mase is the biggest hypocrite pastor out there i know from personal experience…,0
mace messed up this time he signed with snoop omg,0
tell mase we dont need him rapping about nothing we not out here miss him go home mase,0
i agree with you it doesnt make sense for someone to go to a comedy show and be madin reality comedians are a stress reliever,0
people are in hate mode he is a truth teller im so sad that people are sick ,0
please remain quietly in your seat until i dismiss you video ends without him dismissing us well i guess ill have to sit in this seat forever now,0
sometimes im just taking my test and the voice scares me loooool im like where is that coming from,0
the only part i used to struggle with was reading ,0
taking mine after tomorrow havent even prepared adequately for it this is when i want to start studying,0
i offer my prayers and condolences to every child whose parents showed them this,0
it’s every indianasian parents worst nightmare for their kid to get a score physically impossible to improve or get better on lol,0
these people are not high school students they have forgotten some stuff even then the 670 average is a lot higher than the national average of 528 as you have claimed this is more than 1 standard deviation from the mean and almost 2 standard deviations i would think this concludes that chinese people are on average good in sat maths instead of looking at a fixed cutoff score of 700 and concluding that they are not that good,0
money goneeverybody’s story has switched upthe parents are guilty as hellkids traveling and gone for days with grown folkmoney fame sex lies it’s a damn farce,0
parents pimping their kids and thats pure evil and they dont care why aint they being held accountable,0
all need to be on trail parents pimped out their kids they’re all guilty,0
if r kelly goes to jail all the parents of these young ladies need to go too,0
sad but no judgement was he wrong hell yeah but without the enablers he wouldve never gotten away with this everybody was wrong,0
why didn’t they act like this years ago now all of a sudden they mad smh this trial is full of hypocrisy,0
the parents need to go to jail for allowing their daughters to be allowed to be with r kelly,0
whats done in the dark comes to the light all i can say is if there are some women using these types of schemes to just get a bag please do better because theyre actual victims out here of rape or molestation,0
this freaking girl got a 1500 on her freakin psat with no prior practice like wtf i can dream to get that score,0
wait you got a 1500 without any preparations people cant even get that scores after so many practices,0
i feel like a big part of the sat is to be a good test taker there are plenty of very smart people who are not good test takers the sat just does not measure you college readiness well in my opinion,0
it really is scarier than the real test why because i have to score my test and my parents can see them instantly instead of a big break to emotionally fortify yourself for the scores,0
her ok ten minute break me time to have a ten minute power cry over my failed reading section that i rushed through because i was running out of time,0
i promised myself months ago id start studying for sat here i am with no practice and my tests tomo lmao,0
i love how the first thing this guy says is a study regime and here i am 2 days before the sat having studied for maybe like 20 minutes watching this shit,0
in my sophmore year of high school there was a korean girl who spoke no english used a translator machine for the whole year and she would put the questions into the machine and she still managed to finsh first and get the highest grade out of all of us she told me american test so easy like dancing i cant dance either,0

it annoys me that people try to cancel this man he’s been doing stuff that even some governments don’t bother to do,0
when you have a two three four tier justice system things like this happen and criminals run rampant,0
i can tell you why trump filed it with this judge in particular he thinks every judge he appointed owes him for that and will overlook their oath to help him out if this judge says no he will call her a rino and appeal it with another judge as for why now he is hoping he can stall the investigation,0
he needed the documents because deutsche bank doesnt believe hes as rich as he says he is they flat out refused to take eric as collateral,0
he’s had them for 18 months there’s no way of ever knowing who saw them or photographed them until they surface somewhere in the world it’s the most dangerous action he did coz of course he will have shownsoldused them for leverage,0

do republicans realize that we can see them its like jefferson davis trying to take credit for signing the 13th amendment which freed the slaves ,0

the hypocrisy is out of control thanks jake for exposing these hypocritical people we need more of this,0

the federal government guarantees the education loans the lending institution and the universitycollege are not liable for any of the loans thats the problem,0
this is great for some people but you really need to regulate the actual universities who are charging absurd amounts and thatll get lobbied against hard by college corporations,0
remember it’s only federal loans and those parents with less than stellar credit scores could not get federal loans,0
just 40 or 45 years ago going to university in america was free then corporate america took advantage of the educational system the problem is the educational system in america if you are a middle class or poor families going to university in america is a lifetime debt,0
it’s the interest that compounds that becomes a problem puts graduate in a financial prison for years i paid my student loans and i support debt relief it was hard to pay of 10k because of interest,0
student loans should be dischargeable or modifiable in bankruptcy proceedings based on a proper showing of financial hardship it is absurd that the credit card debt on a spring break trip to cancun is unquestionably dischargeable by a bankruptcy court but tuition housing and fees for college are not,0
im 67 a war veteran and i am watching my country being driven off a cliff in a clown car filled with conspiracy nut jobs terrific,0
forget about the evidence said no innocent individual ever more importantly his denial of democracy and proper judicial process is unfathomable,0
the pillow guy screaming forget about the evidence thats all you need to know about him and his followers,0
pretty difficult to change the opinions of people whose opinions dont require evidence especially not by presenting evidence to the contrary,0
“no just forget about the evidence” the gqp have swallowed that bs hook line and sinker,0
i remember when sidney powell said there were so many votes for trump it broke the algorithm i felt my iq drop when she said that i suspect several people developed actual brain cancer as a result,0
these fears and conspiracies really thrive in darkness spot on i find a lot of people that fall for this stuff simply dont bother to seek answers for the questions that they have they keep themselves in the dark on purpose,0
perfect defense for a bank robber your honor my client was just taking the money to a more secure location,0
as someone with the correct clearance i can vouch just like so many of you that this guy didnt keep them in a place that meets requirements for storage of such materials also lying about all this is quick dismissal from your clearance ive seen people fail to get adjudicated for omission of one piece of information they thought wasnt important one lost it for keeping in touch with their mother who is from china their contact with their mother caused them to lose their tssci think about that and this guy and his followers think he did nothing wrong the level of failures here by the former president shows he is illequipped to handle said documents now its just one excuse after another day to day with the people who live in the real world of clearance all know that if we did 1 of what he did we be effed time to put your values you claim into action republicans dont claim it only when its convenient,0
if all documents leaving the oval office were automatically declassified then there should at least be a record of which documents were removed otherwise anyone could take anything out and it would be declassified with no notice but it´s just the same old game first excuse it falls apart so second excuse also falls flat so next excuse something is wrong if you have to change your explanation again and again cause they were proven wrong again and again,0
“roughly as safe as…” as a 27 year military officera jag attorney now a judge that ridiculous slimy phrase sets my teeth on edge it’s like saying a honda civic hatchback is the same as a mercedes s class sedan because they both have 4 wheels ,0

whats in the box anderson cooper just killed me,0
where do they find these people ive sadly thought that everyday for 6 years,0
this might be the time to track down all these threats and show some real consequences to the people that issue them or incite others to issue them this has to stop,0
the people that are making the threats need to be locked up,0
every single person that is found making threats or inciting this nonsense needs to be held accountable these brainwashed clowns are really willing to throw their lives away for a man that could care less about them on any level,0
if i called for the posting of the home address of the judge who signed a warrant for me id be in cuffs for interfering with an official investigation and obstruction of justice before the media ever found it,0
just stunning that the party once proud of standing with the military and for law and order just voted against helping veterans and now shows disrespect and distain for the law and those who serve shame on them,0
these are dark days when an individual can cause this much damage to a country,0
i’ll never forget the devastating story of the judge who’s information was posted online and consequently her teenaged son was murdered when he answered the door at their home this is not acceptable,0
whatever happened to the communicating a threat charge and now that its against the fbi you have to charge these people regardless if you feel if its meaningless or not when have the fbi been afraid to arrest people making death threats what has happened to our government,0
218 all the violent talk is dangerous because even the flippant stuff goads along the people who do finally take violent action it must all be considered serious real threats,0
in canada threats of any kind especially death threats are a chargeable offense,0
this is what we need more of people from different views talking it out and hearing what the other has to say and even if it gets heated they can both shake hands in the end and see the others as equals too often nowadays nobody wants to hear what the otherside has to say they just want to shut it down by saying that their side is better than the other and nothing more,0
the interviewer looks naive to me when he can’t argues with waters he just avoids it by laughing,0
he was reckless with documents people used to have to tape them back together from the trash can but i never known him to destroy documents what in the actual fuck this guy is a lawyer lmao,0
you just said he would throw documents away and at the end of the night people would have to go through the trashcans and dig documents out and tape them back together and then you said you dont believe he would destroy and documents so which is it,0
“any nation that expects to be ignorant and free expects what never was and never will be “ thomas jefferson,0

isn’t he the “legal” parallel to donnie’s “doctor” why do we give him weight why am i watching you ask someone to speculate am i incapable of doing so on my own,0
with so many pot smokers now they should let the people in prison on weed related charges out,0
so 23rds of americans support legal pot but the federal government still says its illegal thanks for representing the will of the people,0
tobacco is almost all downsides and weed is almost all upsides hard to imagine anyone would prefer tobacco to cannabis,0
am a boomer and have smoked weed for over 40 years some people my age arent always truthful about whether they smoke or not,0
a people that elect corrupt politicians imposters thieves and traitors are not victims but accomplices george orwell,0
the question of whether to indict prosecute a former president is irrelevant and immaterial if hes guilty hes guilty,0
647 lets fight crime by prosecuting whiny orange politicians who got taped asking the attorney general in the state of georgia to find them 11780 votes,0
the question of who committed the crime is immaterial that is starting from a wrong premise and does not conform to justice principles in this investigation rather the question should be was a crime committed what crime had been committed and what does the law say about committing such a crime then justice should follow the law does not say unless such a person is a former president,0
france israel and south korea have charged and in two cases convictedone is still pending current or former heads of state in the last 5 years both of the convictions led to prison sentences it hasnt damaged those countries they arent banana republics all this handwringing is pointless if any citizen is to have any faith at all left in the us justice system these crimes need to be charged regardless of the culprit,0
the most significant question of our time is the president of the united states above the law how the doj answers that will determine if democracy fails in america,0
as for me an american citizen i dont feel this has anything to do with political party but everything to do with honesty honor integrityyou dont take what isnt yours i dont care if the president is a republican democrat independentyou dont take government documents home with you its called theft thats a crimeanybody defending him is sicker than he is shame on them,0
we all want to stop talking about dump as soon as he is indicted tried convicted and imprisoned as is appropriate according to the law,0
whenever the republican says “raid” the interviewer needs to respond with “executed a lawful search for evidence of a crime which was obtained legally” and if when they counter with hillary’s emails they need to be reminded that trump was in office for four years and failed to “lock her up” so it’s just an inflammatory phrase,0
sorry scott but garland wont be resigning there wouldnt have been a search warrant issued if there was a chance theyd come away with nothing,0
it would be an insult to american justice system for trump to get away with his accountability,0
the good thing about this is we will know exactly who to blame and hold accountable for the violence if it manifests gop and rump,0
em toda minha vida nunca vi uma leva de jornalistas tão incompetentes e despreparados como a que temos atualmente,0
its unpredidented that a former president should be subjec to a search of his home yep and so was inciting an insurrection and failing to oversee a peaceful transfer of power hypocrits much,0
i love how “breach the confidence of the american public” just means something that the gop doesn’t agree with ,0
he actually had the gall to say this is unprecedented when everything about trump is unprecedented,0
if the republicans win in the midterms what will the oversight look like oversight you gotta be kiddin me there wouldnt be any,0
but her emails coming to bite republicans in the butt,0
anyone being investigated by the fbi is not qualified to be the president of the united states donald trump august 2015,0
there will be more classified information in his head than in his desk you think so he reportedly could not pay attention for 5 seconds when he was briefed about anything i dont think anyone needs to worry about whats in his head regarding state secrets,0
this guy sweating bullets like hes a guilty school kid in the principals office she nailed his ass to the wall that is what an actual journalist does bravo,0
this representative should just say i dont care about the law if its someone that is in my party this is why america is in such a mess the representatives dont do their jobs,0
so this guy whos been the head of the intelligence committee wants to see lots of things from the justice department and fbi now that some action is finally happening involving djts crimes although apparently he was fine with seeing nothing in the last five years of criminal behavior,0
its getting easier to tell by the look on their faces that they dont believe what they are saying,0
it still amazes me that in a country where even the most charming of cussing is beeped away to not shock sensitive souls all of this public deceit dangerous rethoric and violence promotion is tolerated put on display and broadcasted enthusiastically,0
when youre attacking fbi agents because youre under criminal investigation youre losing sarah huckabee sanders wrote in nov 2016,0
i do hope that some people in the us with some common sense know how dangerous the situation is they’re in,0
hold bannon accountable for disinformation,0
desecrating mara largo isnt that what happened at the capitol on jan 6th,0
steve bannon calling people lawless priceless,0
i swear its a tragic comedy we are witnessing,0
i really appreciate your news channel but listen to this guy is too painful for me and i am very sorry to spend on a few seconds to make my comments thank you,0
in the 90s a company i was working in moved operations to china at the time i was thinking what dumbasses and not just because it cost me and my fellow employees our jobs i figured it was just a matter of time before china and the us would be at an impasse and all these companies were going to get yanked out of china were close and while it took longer than i figured but we should start diversifying where our supply chain is located,0
335 “the us should learn a lesson from it instead of making repeated mistakes” makes sensesir but repeated mistakes are kind of our thing  red white and doover…and over…and over again,0
this bill does the exact opposite of what is called thanks to sleepy joes policies we have x2 gas and grocery prices your 96 inflation and drop in annual real wages my condolences to anyone like myself retiring this year 30years of nonstop work just to have a crooked system swallow all your earnings,0
so clever of joes puppetmaster to say that same guy who said dont underestimate joes ability to fk things up,0
and barack obamas right it is a big f deal ,0
what a joke…let’s just keep raising taxes and signing these ridiculous bills…,0
well done joe all the former guy did was play golf watch tv hold rallies post incoherent tweets give the top 1 tax cuts and lie lie lie lie lie,0
“no more wire hangers” this is what a complete and total cult transformation looks like look at the difference just in her demeanor and her physical appearance when she was supporting cheney and how psychotic and dead behind the eyes she looks currently she’s got that marshall applewhite from heavens gate look down pat,0
as a veteran i think back to my military service the oath i took weighs heavily on me right now at the time i wasnt permitted to just say anything that i wanted to my first amendment right to free speech wasnt stripped from me but it was temperedthis wasnt some abysmal violation of my rights i willingly undertook this at the time its high time to pass legislation that holds criminal penalties for candidates and officials who knowingly lie in the face of legally established facts and precedent during bids to seek office and while engaged in the tasks of their office this age of obfuscation has to end with a gaveling that wont let th3 weeds grow back this is toxic to democracy and if it isnt ended soon this new face of fascism will take countless lives and damage to unseat once its entrenchment is complete the coup is ongoing you see,0
the profession overwhelmingly preferred by selfserving unscrupulous immoral andor dishonest individuals law case in point harriet hageman,0
thank you mitch mcconnell for stifling obamas appointment of merritt garland to the supreme courtthe force was at work to save him for a better job of a lifetime to rescue this nation from the rabid demagogues set on destroying our country a deranged unprecedented president calls for legal unprecedented actions,0
top secret and top secret sci sensitive compartmented information as someone who once held military and then civilian clearances necessary to serve in the naval nuclear field then work on several ultrasensitive nuclear and weapons programs the safeguards surrounding these materials are manifold and complex these materials cant be declassified on a whim and certainly dont belong outside of a secure facility none of this passes the smell test in fact it stinks to high heaven let us not forget what 45 did with records pertaining to his infamous call with president zelenskyy information was reclassified then stored under code word protocols could this be some of the material the former president unlawfully had in his possession only time will tell,0
they should have arrested and charged him when they retrieved the first 15 boxes he was guilty then that would have allowed them to rip that place apart to look for more if anyone else had taken those same records we would be in prison for life trump did it and they just went and took them back why did trump want them in the first place,0
trump the warrant cannot be released because it needs to be audited,0
what is one of the first things a defense lawyer will do when faced with anyone who has vital information that can result in the summary conviction of their client if you cant discredit the evidence discredit the witness by any means possible either through facts relevant or otherwise or innuendoes that is exactly what trump and the republican party are attempting to do,0
once youre fired from your job you cant take documents off the premises,0
trumps going to end dementia joe heels up harris warmonger the house drinker and numerous other demonrat careers,0
democrats 4 years ago “the cheney family is a bunch of war criminals” democrats today “i think we should let a cheney run the white house again i agree with none of her policies but at least she hated orange man”,0
i cant even imagine the kind of pressure our ag is under he has the weight of the american public on him he also has the trump mafia on him and his family,0
trump played right into garlands hands,0
i don’t understand aren’t we all for “law and order” and “no one is above the law” it seems to me that the doj and fbi should investigate anyone that might have done anything that a normal person like us would be investigated for and possibly go to jail all corrupt politicians should be investigated regardless of party,0
i find it interesting that when law enforcement does its job these gentlemen would choose to obstruct the persuit of justice rather than support investigators doing their jobs,0
look the fact is this these clowns have always taught they were above the law they can not accept the reality,0
judges do not issue search warrants they sign and authorize them,0
“what were they looking for” “i don’t know” “what wrongdoing do they suspect and why” “i don’t know” “what did they find” “i don’t know” “was it justified” “absolutely not tyranny” do you know or care how utterly stupid such “reasoning” is,0
kevin mccarthy s statement can be used against him as a threat made by him if at all the gop takes the house sensible american would not vote for him this time,0
this is just overreach by my political opponents charles manson,0
he said it himself… “if you are innocent why would you take the fifth amendment”,0
theyre asking the wrong questions you have to ask him something on topic that he wants to answer and just let him talk hell end up answering about 5 questions you didnt think youd get an answer to let him talk hes his own worst enemy,0
he does everything he accuses his opponents of doing publicly on video openly and his supporters say it doesnt happen you cant argue or debate that you can only ignore stupidity at the level of the average republican citizen at least as far as deciding who to charge,0
ted cruz is a total hypocrite and until recently a canadian citizen who may not even have a legal right to run for president donald trump 2015,0
well for the first time in his life he’s telling the truth pleading the 5th is an admission of guilt that he has committed crimes,0
i wanted to talk but my lawyer wouldnt let me will be trumps excuse,0
just subpoena him hes just doing this to stall for time hell string them along for weeks if not months and then in the end say no he changed his mind and then they will have to subpoena him anyway so just cut to the chase already get it done,0
the answer could had been yes or no listening to his talking points tell you he’s a hypocrite,0
this is not that tough he is saying send me a subpoena so i have a legal excuse against the lunatics in my own party,0
the unique role of honoring your oath while trying to avoid being murdered by a mob of cranked up conspiracy theorists,0
im baffled by the way to different sides interpret a win for the average american spending taxes for the republicans is good as long as its on military equipment breaks for the corporations its bad spending if its tax breaks lower healthcare prices anything that helps the average american taxpayer who by the way is paying taxes already themselves   its insanity,0
late in the game joe biden’s only been in office a little over a year and a half late in the game,0
regardless of which side of the aisle you vite for i dont believe for a second that any regular american is going to shed a tear or lose any sleep over billion dollar corporations having to pay their fair share of taxes,0
its nice to see neighbors playing dressup and role play on a fine summer day must be nice to not have a job you have to go to somehow i just cannot understand how playing dressup makes people feel like they belong to something,0
these are actual adults who never grew beyond juvenile delinquency,0
someone was in high school he refuses to listen to teachers and even refused to read books so now that he is not anymore a student he suddenly wants to listen to teachers and read books something is wrong somewhere with donald,0
they are so clueless of how the entire thing was done how all the evidence was gathered what goes into getting a warrant it didnt happen over night,0
hahah hilarious its like adult children carrying guns around like youre going to take on the fbi,0
also dont they have a job or something how can they afford to stay there doing nothing,0
if you are going to put liars like mulvaney on air you need to stop them and push back every time they lie dont just let them build a big case based on unfounded assertions,0
mishandling of classified documents is a felony no intent or plans are relevant having those documents was a crime period,0
documents theres a difference between documents and classified information mick how the hell were you in the whitehouse,0
“just documents” classified documents in unauthorized hands and insecure property is “just documents”,0
im not defending destroying documents im just defending the man who broke a federal law for destroying documents,0
this guy is an insufferable weasel stop inviting him to speak,0
its interviews like this that give people like him legitimacy when they dont deserve any giving a platform to dishonesty is not balance or equity,0
nobody is asking why did trump need to take any of these documents how is it mulvaney is focused on procedure impropriety and confidence in rhe fbi and not wondering why after months they resorted to going thru all these steps undoubtedly they ask pretty please for at least 6 months another example of the best people,0
if the president ripped up a document we taped it back togetheri never saw the intentional destruction of documents i saw documents handled in the ordinary course of business they might be defaced we fixed them how is ripping up a document considered to be in the ordinary course of business hes admitted that they were defaced,0
imagine being forced to cheerlead the company that just fired you,0
the fact that stelter was sacked before lubin’ toobin… says a lot,0
can’t wait to hear mark dice do his voice over on this one wow stelteryou got a three decade old show canceled how bad do you have to be we know we know you are a scoundrel and the “media” is better now that you’re gone he said he’s excited to watch cnn and root for them what a lie the fake applause at the end is appropriate of this lousy host,0
“if you are innocent why are you taking the 5th amendment “ trump,0
“you see the mob takes the fifth” trump “if you’re innocent why are you taking the fifth amendment” trump “fifth amendment fifth amendment horrible” trump,0
why does no one ask why he took them why its taken so long to get it back and can the people who helped take the documents be held accountable too,0
so ive been reading republican feedback that it is totally fine for trump to take government docs as long as they dont contain sensitive info or that its fine for trump to keep docs because theyre safe at mar a lago with all the security he enjoys that sounds so off right,0
if the market is so heavily effected by a tweet then it isnt based in reality a home gallons of gas or milk etc are always in demand and you cant say the price doubled because of economics why do economy dynamics always favor the rich the prices never fall when the current crisis is over not significantly,0
people were saying there would be a housing cash there are companies buying up home to turn owning a home into a business pricing regular people out of buying a house there is a shortage of homes and las vegas i havent seen the prices go down greedy companies are pricing renters out of the ability to find a place to rent,0
part of the problem is millions sold their homes to large companies like black rock instead of to actual families those type of companies want money so they jack up the rent and never sell those homes to families i know everyone want money but think twice about selling your home to those companies every time you do you prevent other families from being able to afford a home and subject them to outrageous rent prices i speak from experience,0
so its basically greed got it theres too much money out there lets change that,0
that is a load of crap the reason rents are going up is corporations buying up rentals houses apartment buildings and then escalating the rent to make money mortgage rates are not that high look what they were under reagan 185 now that was high,0
rents are going up because of greed,0
333 wtf makes landlords think theyre entitled to make up for pandemicrelated losses  why are they special and deserving of being immune and exempted from taking a hit can all the people who werent able to go to work for several months and had to live off of their savings or become homeless demand a raise to make up for the money they didnt make why are landlords and banks and such allowed to demand to not share the burden ,0
at least in my town we have 1 old zoning law that prevents thousands of affordable lots from being developed lift that restriction and ideally streamline permitting and loosen regulations but they wont too much local vested interest in keeping the supply down i know my town isnt the only one with this zoning law,0
those of us who had security clearances while serving in the military know how truly serious the mishandling and appropriation of classified materials is,0
all president trump had to do was give the fbijustice department all of those documents that they wanted the first time that he got a subpoena and there wouldnt be all of this drama right now once again he creates problems and then blames others when they have to clean up his mess,0
for once hold this crook accountable lock him up ,0
i had a tssci clearance when i was in the air force i had to go into a special facility called a “scif” that was under 24 hour armed guard etc to even have access to that type of information unbelievable,0
the question is why wasnt he arrested back when it was first discovered hes taken the documents he claims that his staff must have accidentally grabbed them with the moving boxes as he was leaving the wh has that ever happened before has any other president accidentally moved over 20 boxes full of classified documents when they left,0
can we now say lock him up,0
does anyone remember dump saying im the president i can do anything i want to do i remember that sick man with a god complex and obviously a very sick man,0
put him to jail and i will believe “no man is above the law” not even current and previous presidents,0
who knew there were so many traitors living amongst us,0
making falsehoods to the public like the ones he is spouting need to be made illegal with steep punishments this is not exercising free speech he and his filthy ignorant supporters have no qualms about creating more societal chaos with their abject lies this practice needs to be brought to an end,0
well if the documents were planted then how could he possibly have declassified them,0
the day trump left officei remember a comment being made about him taking documentsand the comment waswhy is he taking those documents,0
criminals are gonna protect other criminals thats how it works,0
if my neighbor robs a bank and a few weeks later i decide to rob the same bank it makes no difference i would have committed a serious crime regardless and exactly how did agents sneak in and plant 12 plus boxes of evidence in advance of the raid in supposedly secure locked rooms and safes with video security and guards and secret service on the property omg ridiculous,0
it should be illegal for politicians to lie to the public or mis lead the public intentionally,0
he was a captain as a veteran of the us army i am appalled that someone in the military would act this way i said this before and ill say it again i am proud to have worn the uniform im just not proud of who else has sabatini is a clown and a disgrace to the uniform and the country,0
its disgusting and horrifying that there are people walking around like this especially if hes aspiring to be in any position of power,0
as a former military officer myself i cannot fathom how sabatini ever passed a background check let alone became an infantry officer his actions and comments are a classic example of conduct unbecoming of an officer he needs to resign from the national guard before he destroys its reputation,0
as another viewer from outside it’s quite appalling that people vote for such crazy and dangerous people the issue with protecting the right to talk absolute nonsense is that there are a significant number of people who are simply not smart enough to recognise it,0
they know full well what they are doing theyve shown repeatedly that they dont care about the constitution or laws that hold them accountable laws are for everyone else they are just pulling everyones leg its simply and literally a game to them thats what abusers do,0
whenever i think about moving back to the us florida being my home state and i see these videos it’s just a gut punch how deluded can a society become,0
an honest but mistaken man once shown the truth either ceases to be mistaken or ceases to be honest a people that elect corrupt politicians imposters thieves and traitors are not victims but accomplices george orwell,0
real republicans would feel their skin crawl looking at that interview with the florida man what did trump do to them,0
apparently he forgot the oath he took when he signed up for his service,0
i disagree and heres what i think the real problem islegitimate law firms with good reputations dont want to be remembered as the agency who represented benedict donald,0
the trouble is that this man hit the nail on the head when he said that he would find it inappropriate to become part of a team attempting to tear down the justice system you could start off with the best of intentions but in no time at all you would find yourself standing in shit up to your neck there is no way of working with trump and doing it right forget it,0
well we know he has one attorney that has had to go to jail for him another attorney who is about to be indicted and another attorney testifying in front of the january 6th committee so i think its safe to say that most smart attorneys are not going to think that representing this man is worth it plus they know they wont get paid,0
it turns out that competent lawyers wont actually sit in front of a federal judge and lie for you,0
i would have to give up all of my other clients yes code for he does not want to be disbarred like rudy no honest lawyer can defend pos 45,0
one of the saddest lessons of history is this if we’ve been bamboozled long enough we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle we’re no longer interested in finding out the truth the bamboozle has captured us it’s simply too painful to acknowledge even to ourselves that we’ve been taken once you give a charlatan power over you you almost never get it back carl sagan,0
theres a huge difference between saying i represented the president of the united states and i represented donald trump theres a reason that many people who worked in the trump administration are concerned about future employment opportunities,0
he lost me at it makes us look like extremist democrats why the hell can these people not respond to a direct question about their behavior without trying to deflect to democrats,0
respect for defending our country respect for being a navy seal respect for everything you sacrificed for our country respect for wanting to continue to serve our country through politics no respect for you as a politician though nearly everything you said was bullshit,0
this man crenshaw probably had access to this type of material when he was a seal on active duty knows the gravity these documents held for him to standup and defend someone who violated the protocol associated with these materials is an insult to the men and women who secure these documents and keep us safe,0
he lost me at it makes us look like extremist democrats why the hell can these people not respond to a direct question about their behavior without trying to deflect to democratsi agree with ms claire what is he talking about if a democrat was doing what trump was doing what would he say and do take some bloody responsibility,0
there are ways to resolve that issue yeah like not stonewalling the national archives for a year and a half or signing a sworn affidavit that youve returned all the records when its a blatant lie,0
how many people out there would have several months to comply with felony related inquiries to keep you out of prison even one chance to provide these documents is one more than any one else would have been given,0
you know what trips me out is that instead of just taking responsibility these political hacks point out when the other side did it and pointing fingers instead of being a normal adult and just take responsibility,0
mr mcconnell…please retire it’s simply time for you to go,0
“i say this to my republican colleagues who are defending the indefensible there will come a day when donald trump is gone but your dishonor will remain — liz cheney the stain will never wash out,0
i’m just shocked by some peoples voting habits dem margins need to widen not shrink not to mention gerrymandering or redistricting is still a major issue,0
the fact that raphael warnock is leading by only four points should allow the world to see that something is very very wrong with the voters of the united states,0
mcconnells only goal is to become senate leader again why listen to him he acts only in selfinterest not for the good of americans hes supposed to be representing i think he cares who is in the white house not for americans interests but he cares like all narcissists only about how that president would impact his power mcconnell has refused to do his job for years by sitting on bills that americans want passed and refusing to act in fact he has been smugly crowing about it mcconnell like trump is very angry that he lost his position his only focus concern is getting his power back he has been in congress way too long hes secured his millions his days of glory are over he should be removed from office,0
since arriving in the senate in 2011 ron johnson has repeatedly backed policies that would leave veterans out in the cold including voting against expanded healthcare job training and educational opportunities for those who have served in uniform ron johnson’s record makes clear that he has not served in the senate with the best interests of wisconsin veterans in mind,0
americans are getting fedup with the lack of a reasonable and comprehensive set of policies by the gop coupled with the extremist and radical views of so many of their members in the house and the senate,0
what a moody manipulative and selfserving man mitch mcconnell is,0
republicans wouldnt have a chance in the house if it represented the people like it is supposed to gerrymandering has destroyed the house,0
“they are cowards and history will show it” well said,0
theyre afraid and theyre cowards and history will show it that is a powerful statement which is probably lost on trump and his cronies,0
in the course of appealing my divorce settlement which was made without me even being in the room the judge told the opposing attorney you lied to me if you dont go outside and settle with this man ill make sure you never win another case in this court so long as im presiding judge yes folks it happens orders get pencil whipped all the time,0
pressure from the public how has the public put pressure on the judge pressure has come from media outlets how can americans help the judge understand that we dont need or want to see the affidavit in my opinion what americans want is for the dojfbi investigation to continue unimpeded and to continue without witness intimidation,0
all those classified documents have been compromised may as well tell the about the damage and start looking for the copies he was planning to blackmail local government and foreign,0
you mean putin didnt tell the truth im utterly shocked i mean noone saw that coming did they lol,0
this has nothing to do with hybrid warfare call it what it is terrorism simple plain cowardly terrorism,0
just a thought russia could do a lot of damage short of causing a meltdown make the reactors unusable contaminate the site etc,0
usually when russians say their foe is doing something inhumane it is a clear sign that they are about to commit that very same crime themselves,0
how can it be the russians shelling it when it hasnt been shelled for months,0
as someone who does not live in the united states can anyone explain to me why the country is being held hostage by the nations halfwits,0
never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups george carlin,0
i have to admit when hillary first called these people a basket of deplorables i winced and recoiled in embarrassment but now,0
one of the things that always puzzled me why would they pick jfk jr the whole kennedy family is democrat do they not know that either,0
my god these were the people that got trump elected in 2016 maybe a requirement to vote shouldnt be your age but your iq,0
the older i get i am finding that i dont have any patience for cult members who deliberately choose to be stupid i cant even watch it,0
going from a civil rights lawyer representing the aclu to calling it an honor to rep trump and bannon is a very weird bag,0
i cannot believe this former “civil rights” lawyer just spouted rightwing rhetoric wtf,0
it still amazes me how adult professionals continue to make excuses for the former potus let alone an adult who behaves more like a bad child than a leader of the free world,0
i am an attorney and in the course of my career i have defended some pretty bad people but i have my limits i would decline to represent someone like bannon or trump i wouldn’t want that stink on me,0
what a sad lawyer that must be for him to consider it a great honor to represent donald trump hahahahah,0
he didnt believe he was doing anything wrong by refusing to turn over these documents who in their right mind would want such a weak minded person that refuses to listen to advisors as president,0
“representing steve bannon…” that will assure you a place in hell,0
ex trump lawyer still defending him i can not believe how they stick with him,0
work at a bank and take work home fired happened to me work as a president and take classified work home that could not was but could be stolen or used against the us technically by the books they’re supposed to be automatically safely assumed to be a traitor removed from any office and jailed for life technically speaking in a perfect world,0
remember him once saying during an interview i dont stand behind anything after all hes shown us of himself if you believe anything he says now youre a fool after it is released he will tell his followers look i had no privacy at all they had no right to release this info,0
first he got fired then he tried to steal anything not nailed down all the while he running around yelling stop the steal ,0
every time this guy still says i dont know we have to see what happens thats this attorneys answer to everything,0
this is driving me crazy why isnt the media not asking the key question why did he take the documents,0
im bored of the trump realityshow can we skip ahead to the part where hes in jail and fading from memory,0
the best way to get a narcissist is to figure out their weakness and fears under the facade of a tough narcissist is a fearful person always seeking to boost their ego,0
a grade school teacher i once had used to tell us repeatedly your sins will find you out trump must have skipped all those classes that would explain his reckless criminality on so many levels not to mention his basic stupidity as far as michael cohen is concerned theres a guy who not only uses his brain but demonstrates courage contrition humility and a renewed sense of civic pride in stark contrast to any trump behavior,0
ironically trump himself signed a law in 2018 that made it a felony to remove and retain classified documents,0
how did we ever come to this if i were a younger person starting out in this world i would strongly concider not bringing a child into the world my heart soul are broken for what everyone faces ahead in prayers will we be here the best of all possible worlds ,0
personally i think education or specifically a lack thereof is one of the strongest driving forces behind things like this because ignorance breeds fear and distrust especially in things that are new or foreign when i was in elementary school back in the 70s i was reading my way through my schools scifi section it was just a few shelves but it had almost all the classics asimov bova bradbury campbell clarke doc smith heinlein and then i got to verne id just finished up 30000 leagues and was getting into journey to the center of the earth when i found a page had been ripped from the book being a good student i reported it to the librarian but instead of focusing on the missing page she was outraged that i was reading this particular book it was above my level she said and too difficult for me this was a hundredyearold story at this point and i was pretty sure it wasnt a difficult one to follow the movie was even one of my favorites every time it aired on creature feature on saturdays but she still took the book away and over the next few weeks that scifi section became empty shelves as she removed and locked away almost all the books there a short time later i overheard her talking to another teacher about of all things a shooting star a meteor that many had seen a night or two before the librarian was mocking the teacher because a shooting star is impossible the heavens are permanent the stars dont move as the teacher tried to explain the idea of a meteor it seemed to both terrify and outrage her and the longer that conversation went on the more even i maybe 10 or 11 years old at the time realized the scifi books she had removed werent above my level they were above her level she had no understanding of science and all these scifi stories about starships robots and alien worlds were things that she just didnt understand and because of that they scared her so she locked them away and unfortunately it sounds like that sort of mindset hasnt changed all that much in the 40 or so years since then,0
whenever i heard a book was banned from my school library i would immediately check it out from the public library i learned a lot about menstruation from “dear god it’s me margaret” one summer i was 8 and completely traumatized when i realized it happens to my mom too i’m not helping here… my point being more students will now read these books than before banning them,0
when one parent doesnt want their child to read a certain book they can fill out a form so no child in the school can read it that sounds more like indoctrination than education instead of removing the book from the whole school they should just disallow that one student access to the book sorry johnny you cant check out that book because your parents said so,0
i’m a pubic school teacher this is part of the reason that there is a shortage of qualified teachers teachers are just sick and tired of being sick and tired they are finding jobs where they are respected,0
this downward spiral of our country should scare every single one of us well those of us who actually know history and what all this kind of nonsense can lead to scary indeed,0
for a country with a terrible education rating in the world youre doing your best to fall further down the list,0
i remember my high school history teacher saying its a race between education and catastrophe,0
people who begin by burning books will end by burning people heinrich heine,0
it’s absolutely ridiculous to try stop anyone from reading what they want they’ll just find another way…even your kids the perpetuation of ignorance is the true concern,0
“it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it”,0
if jones didnt do it on purpose then why is he still doing it everyday during his trial,0
its also difficult to get someone to tell the truth when his salary depends on him lying,0
first sentence and he started to liedid not do this mistake on purpose so out of accident he reported on this matter over the course of 5 years numerous times but it wasnt intentional he just asked questions and ohhe lied over and over and over again this guy will never admit his wrongs morally compromised he is nothing else,0
theres no accounting at his business irs are you listening how could this possibly be true,0
so he’s still lying about his intention how much more could he possibly pay in light of the fact we know he’s still lying about this situation why do people follow him if they know he’s lying,0
alex jones defense might actually be brilliant i didnt do it on purpose look at the lawyer he hired sent the prosecution all the evidence they needed i didnt do it on purpose he lied under oath i didnt do it on purpose i mean hes clearly guilty of torturing the victims of an elementary school shooting his choosen defense is the only option that had at least a 1 chance of working but ultimately him hiding his own money so he can declare bankruptcy defense is much stronger the old white man defense,0
the company “had no accounting dept” how is that possible,0
its time to stop treating these people like they have any honor decency or redeeming qualities they dont,0
we expect more from our leaders and if if they have no class and character they should be exposed,0
good for obama tired of republican slandering games,0
trump and adonis are the last two words i would have expected to hear in a sentence even today i agree with the first statement saying biden could defend himself but i dont think everyone would look at the email and see it as a sermon setting someone straight and telling them what they did was unexpected and improper isnt a sermon its giving them a wakeup call also yes no physician should ever pass judgement like that without examining a person first its not rude its unprofessional he basically flaunted his status as a dr to troll inb4 trump tweets bi im fabulous,0
i disagree with david i admire obama for speaking out the truth thats rare these days im from uk and sadly see the same kind of politics here immoral and discussing ,0
damn obama went with the im not mad but im hella disappointed approach,0
doesnt jacksons response sound exactly like trump wrote it ,0
so wait if your property gets raided its weird and questionable to be the first person to talk about it wtf is wrong with these people,0
i wasnt even planning on voting this midterms this woke everyone up,0
the world is laughing at us as we slowly split our country apart these people have abused there power for too long now,0
i am embarrassed for my fathers country i would like to apologize to every soldier who ever died under our flag i wish i could give you your life back because it was in vain,0
if this actually does end up getting trump reelected in the future i will laugh harder than i ever have,0
i’m somewhere in the middle and with the way the economy is all the denial from biden this just broke my trust in the government i can’t trust them at all from this point on period,0
it’s very rare that something like this would ever happen to a former president in fact this is a first,0
this is the government our founding fathers warned us about,0
sooo gullible the government is not going to lie ,0
i hate when they say were a nation of laws the law is written interpreted and enforced differently for different people,0
when are we as a nation going back to sincere governance elections are partisan by nature but governing is not supposed to be encumbants are tasked to address all the needs of all the citizenry the job of leadership should never be to retard the nations progress when their party doesnt hold the majority the lies and the one upmanship has got to stop the victory should be seen as the nations rather than just one party or the other it is the job of all who are serving to facilitate our progress we are so much better than what we have been doing we may have fallen short of our ideal but we should never stop striving we are guaranteed not to make it if we quit,0
i obejct to her saying pence was a hero not because i dont think he did the right thing but rather he had no legal alternative this is like saying pence is a hero for not committing burglary today,0
i just need 11780 votesguilty,0
i’m extremely far behind on my classes and your teaching me more then my teachers have so far,0
its confirmed the only reason i hated chemistry untill now was because my teachers werent good enough hes so dedicated in what hes doing earned my respect,0
i would make a joke about gravity but noone would fall for that,0
i love physics but it makes me question everything and i have had multiple nights where i was deeply disturbed by it,0
omg this is a pure masterpiece biology is the part that got me shivers the most even though its the only among the four that im not studying right now,0
the dislikes are the teachers who just got outclassed,0
who else is here because learning over zoom teaches you nothing,0
this is just like having a philosophy student in a law or politics class,0
lady destroyed racisms 7 years ago respect,0
fungi are like the weird cousin of plants and animals ah yes that weird cousin who has a habit of feeding off their relatives corpses once theyve died,0
man i thought he was gonna explain all my 10 years of medical studies in 9 min he didnt even touch the atom of the galaxy,0
a virus interacts with its environment uses energy and reproduces but viruses are argued to be not living organisms maybe this is because they cant independently reproduce they require the cellular machinery of the host cell to manufacture new viruses,0
as a biology major this video made me feel sad for not having great professionals as passionate to their jobs as this man,0
im allergic to penicillin and azithromycin round of applause for the parents,0
people i just don’t think people should be able to use it for cosmetic purposes scientists bold of you to assume we know how to do that,0
i once was kayaking with my father in florida when i took a break from rowing a beautiful dragonfly landed on the end of my ore about 12 seconds of me gawking at it went by before a bigger dragonfly landed on top of the first and proceeded to quickly rip its head off after it decapitated my new found friend it took off with the body leaving the head sitting on my ore with my jaw on the floor in total shock of what murder i had just witnessed that day i learned that dragon flies are metal as fuck,0
the counterbalance to deal with aerodynamic flutter is some really incredible biomechanics ive seen videos of flutter being tested on airplanes and its no joke that can quickly ruin your day,0
the most fearsome predator of the sea sharks the orca literally torturing other animals for fun am i a joke to you,0
that footage of the finless shark plummeting to the sea floor was appalling im incredibly glad you showed it but its appalling im not outright against the killing of animals but the combination of outright cruelty and waste is just mind bending i struggle with how humans can so easily disconnect from certain realities i struggle with how i see it in myself as well a fisherman would know that these sharks would still be alive when theyre thrown back in if they just stopped to even think about what theyre doing if theyre hellbent on wasting the rest of the shark just slit the damn things throat before you throw it back you sick fuck,0
how on earth does wired get the professionals who are literally the most passionate people on the planet,0
as someone obsessed with biology im pretty disappointed that the map of biology received the least views of all the sciences,0
these videos are good but i have two minor criticisms of this one 1 structural biology is concerned with the structure of large macromolecules amino acids are all small molecules so they fall more under the purview of biochemistry your description is almost verbatim one of the sentences from the opening paragraph of the wikipedia page on structural biology but i dont think thats correct 2 biomedical engineering is the field that makes artificial organs and other medical devices biotechnology uses living organisms or their products for our purposes synthetic biology creates synthetic organisms and is closely related to biotechnology but the latter two fields arent closely related to the first,0
my earphones get tangled all the time but miles and miles of dna dont mind blowing,0
why is a teenage boy similar to helicase they both want to unzip your genes grins im speechless,0
the fact that whalesdolphins can legally just be kept at places like seaworld is just insane given just the information in this video,0
i remember watching black fish and hearing one of the sailors sent to capture the first set of orca calves remark about how when getting the calves in the boats the vocalizations they heard made them realize they were taking a baby and that its family was crying because of it really unnerving information for a college student aiming to become a scientist,0
im from mexico and it kills me to see that one of our national treasures is dying off also feel very much impotent at the fact that i cant do much about it c,0
while really interesting i cant help but feel bad for all the axelotl that had to endure amputation and maybe worse for this to be researched especially the one that got their rejuvenation blocked,0
i cut off tip of my thumb and it regrew i was told it was because i retained nail bed which produces stem cells it was incredible process there was nothing to stitch shut no skin and couldnt reattach tip so they used a special material on it for a while removing that was horrifying but there isnt even any scar tissue and my finger print grew back too however the nerves didnt fair quite as well it has that asleep pins and needles feeling to it so i did physical therapy to get used to fine motor tasks and its pretty much normal now i wonder if animals new limbs have less sensitivity too though ,0
all the dislikes are the students that had to take notes on this for biology,0
pov ur teacher sent u hear then u got bored now ur reading comments,0
povyou were drawing in science class while they played this video so now you’re struggling with the worksheet alone,0
it’s kind of crazy how cells are so small,0
ants are truly insane did you know that wood ants even sacrifice their own lives to save their colony the territorial battles that break out between neighboring anthills each spring are warfare of the highest order involving thousands of casualties and chemical weapons our film team was thrilled when they watched two colonies how they conduct scouting expeditions and subdue their enemies,0
i love that even the indigenous people from australia who already deal with tons of weird animals were like nah this little guy is too weird to be normal,0
i love the way you teach i have adhd and can never pay attention so thanks for being weird and not boring like most professors with my adhd it affects me remembering things i want to actually know and learn this subject and other subjects and not just memorize for the test then forget everything a month later any advice on studying or other tips to really keep the info embedded in my mind,0
pierre changed his whole production style too many people copying his beats,0
i hate how underrated this man is but i lowkey like it at the same time,0
slaps like an abusive relationship,0
genuine question during the experiment with the dead fish how did the eel knew the fish responded to its doublet when there was an agar barrier between them placed there to particularly impede the electric shock you mentioned the eels eyesight is poor and they rely heavily on their electrolocation of prey answers are appreciated thanks,0
i keep on getting med school ads on these bio videos and im like dude im just tryna pass grade 10 calm down,0
my bio teacher is wellknown for not paying attention to any of her classes except chemistry and then at the end of the year giving out candy to all of her other classes and apologizing for being a shitty teacher of course that does nothing to raise my grade in her class but these videos do thanks so much yall for helping me understand this flipping course,0
its such a shame this song wasnt a hit in america this is pop perfection,0
the choreographer clearly gave them like two runthroughs of the dance before running out of time and just saying fuck it thisll do,0
watching this the day before my bio exam and realizing that i’m so gonna fail,0
the fact that humans need stab proof vest to survive one of these guys tells you how deadly they can be,0
and there are still people that dare to say modern dinosaurs are boring just take a look at this absolute unit,0
im from brazil and i heard ranchers telling stories such as about that time their grandpa saw a harpy lifting a newborn calf duting his youth or that day a harpy snatched a hound in goiás clearly exagerations wild tales but it shows the reverence respect and even fear the harpy commands on people also the state police here where im from has harpia as a callsign their helicopters,0
i wonder if the harpy calls werent only used to identify primates without a response but to actually wear down their awareness overtime by conditioning them to expect calls before seeing the eagle we might see more of those mixups and mindgames if we observed them in areas where primates lived alongside eagles for more than a year,0
probably shouldve paid attention in class questioning life choices,0
adenosine triphosphate shoots off third phosphate group adenosine die phosphate,0
my brain is not excepting this knowledge,0
well i disagree with the answer to question 27 because mitochondria itself has its own dna,0
dumb idea a ca video thats literally just exploring life on earth describing the lifeforms with examples from fictional works in a role reversal way treating the very real animals like their pieces of speculative work and vice versa ie in the vast earth oceans live an apex predator unchanged for millions of years the shark though they look remarkably simular to the squidsharks of 4546b but are more closely related to earth fish than squids as a terrible example,0
something ive noticed about alien spec bio things is that i dont often see structures analogous to fur or feathers on the critters i wonder why,0
some people still ask why are there still apes or monkeys it should be obvious that such people lack an understanding of what evolution is and how it works apparently someone told such people that humans evolved from apes and from that due to their lack of education they assumed that all apes were supposed to evolve into humans that is not how evolution works but creationists have no interest in learning anything other than creation mythology they might just as well have asked if dogs are descended from wolves why are there still wolves or even if americans came from europe why are there still europeans just as dogs descended from a population of wolves so too did humans evolve from one particular population of apes what we know is that the first apes evolved in africa about 25 million years ago from a population of old world monkeys whereas monkeys run on all four feet across the tops of branches apes evolved the ability to swing arm over arm from branch to branch evolution works to make each species best suited to their environment for apes that environment was the forest and they are well suited for it at one time there were about 30 different species of apes in those forests had environmental conditions remained the same we would still see forests covering the whole african continent however conditions did not stay the same the climate became drier as a result forested areas shrank in size and were replaced by grasslands the african savanna with just a few scattered trees the shrinking forests put different ape species in competition with each other and many went extinct then about 6 or 7 million years ago one population of apes split with some of them opting for life on that open savanna all apes are capable of walking upright they are just not comfortable doing so for long periods of time recent experiments with trained chimps on a treadmill have shown that for them walking upright was more efficient in terms of energy expended than quadrupedal walking chimps and other apes though must shift their weight from side to side while walking bipedaly that savanna environment favored skeletal changes that placed the knees directly under the center of gravity by about 4 mya our ancestral australopithecines had almost the same pelvis femur knees and feet as modern humans that gave them a smooth stride that was efficient for long distance travel they did however retain long arms and curved fingers enabling them to climb a tree when danger threatened the apes that remained in a forest environment were under little pressure to change they became the ancestors of todays chimps and bonobos those living in the open were presented challenges not experienced by woodland apes and that required greater intelligence and cooperation to overcome them it set their descendants on a different evolutionary trajectory that culminated in us,0

when youre watching this because your bio teacher cannot teach,0
my biology textbook is the worst thing ever written a full chapter takes only about a page and teaches nothing thank god for crash course,0
if hippos were carnivores that lit their prey on fire so all the nightmares at once,0
this is what causes some bugs i think one lizard and also one jesus to be able to walk on water hank how the hell were you able to say that with a straight face ,0
i credit crash course with my success in bio105 when you cover 2 chapters a week and youre taking 15 credit hours4 classes total its pretty much hilariously impossible to actually grasp the material as you progress and really understand it,0
this is literally an entire semester of a 400level evolutionary developmental biology course summed up in a 5 minute song fucking legendary,0
biology aside someone has to mention how absolutely insane this acapella is musically he is not using any external instruments apart from his damn mouth absolutely incredible,0
back before we blew up the cambrian like a bomb bomb shoutout to the precambrian explosion,0
why recreate adversity im definitely part of that subgroup against bonsai its crippling trees for just aesthetics and theres also some weird control issues to unpack around it just get some plants that are good for your local wildlife,0
people like to talk about torturing trees like they dont cut their grass every week,0
so a bonsai could theoretically become a normal huge tree when planted elsewhere but the question is is a tree “happier” when it grows way bigger or is the tree happy when it’s small too the obvious answer is no the tree doesn’t care another answer would be “we have no way of knowing” people like to assign emotions to things but a lot of the time those emotions are just selfreflection people assign the wrong emotions to animals too even though we know animals can feel emotion people still misunderstand them and describe them incorrectly this happens all the time so even when we find out trees can experience emotion and some evidence already suggests this we would probably still force our own perspective onto them like we do now what we do know for a fact is that plants do what they do with the conditions they are given are they “satisfied” being the tree that they are i don’t think trees know this concept i think people shouldn’t anthromorphise their idea of “succes and satisfaction” onto plants in fact people already project their ideas of success onto other people and animals who don’t need it the trees definitely don’t need it either,0
no one chemist ill just throw acid on a gas vehicle,0
cant help but quote douglas adams there is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the universe is for and why it is here it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable there is another theory which states that this has already happened”,0
sending the electron through a magnetic field doesnt seem like asking are you spin up or down but rather will you orient yourself up or down when subjected to this field and it seems logical that the leftright alignment would be random after that since then youre asking will you orient yourself left of right when subjected to this orthogonal field anyway taking this sort of observer centric view probably often leads one to boltzmann brains and other rather useless hypersimplified things,0
im a physics graduate and watching the experts discussions made me feel like sht the more you learn the more you realize how much you actually dont know,0
they cheated by hiring the smartest 8yearold they could find,0
ive studied a bit of all sorts of physics quantum physics classical and relativistic physics regarding nuclear energy and radioactive decay but ive noticed that the classical physics of nyoton is still the hardest for me especially the motion of liquids and solid objects like projectiles,0
it’s hard to believe it’s been five years since the president of the united states stared at an eclipse twice,0
how does this work hmm i dont know why dont you tell m number two,0
years ago i was a physics major life didnt turn out the way i initially expected and now im in cs classes including theory of computation this video is very much the intersection of stuff ive studiedstudying and hits hard,0
real reasons our eletric bills are so high,0
all i got out of this is our electric bills will never be free,0
i was attacked by ceti years ago trying to prove that there were aliens,0
i have a pretty big physics problem that has perplexed me my whole life the closest supermarket from where i live is 500 meters roughly and it takes me 12 minutes to walk there and back at a walking speed of 5 kph 3 mph the problem is it has taken my father 18 years to make this trip and i want to know how this strange phenomenon has occurred,0
he’s “rich” but can’t afford better quality lol ,0
ahhh problems with the standard model whod have guessed i had some wonderful arguments with particle physicists while living near cern a few years back but ive had problems with this particular theory since the copenhagen interpretation of the 1920s,0
i feel terrible for bob  he sounds like he’s crying 1 like 1 prayer for bob,0
she was my life she filled my soul she was part of my heart all this coming from a 8 year old im 11 years old and i dont even have a friend thats a girl,0
physics is so interesting when you actually get to know and understand it i really want to sue all my school teachers for not doing their jobs correctly and for only scraping the surface when it comes to physics it really is just so frustrating when you are so interesting in something that you cant even understand properly,0
it tells us that we are looking at the universe through the wrong end of the telescope,0
i thought the content and editing of this docu was really very good let down however once again by an agonising and overly intrusive soundtrack of bings bongs muzak and mood noise that was so distracting it was actually fighting the content for my attention please please dispense with this nonsense or offer a noise pollution free variant it is such a problem in shows such as this horizon in the uk is especially bad,0
as if the designers of the universe overlooked the possibility that a species would evolve enough to work out some of it no wonder it makes no sense at a quantum level when they realise what were up to well know they know imagine that was actually true d,0
304 i can tell by the multiple times he says he’s getting high ground and how physics doesn’t care the he’s one of those obsessive jerks that keeps bullying even though no one really cares cleary the high ground doesn’t matter because every time he absolutely bodied him,0
life man what is it even,0
when your physics teacher doesnt teach you physics so you rely on the internet,0
does the sound dim at random points for anyone else its like someone muffled the mic arbitrarily,0
235 i dont think ronnie wants to buy the whole restaurant,0
can i just say that n3on is a savage rn,0
imagine this guy with his personality if he is not rich,0
damn man im seeing physics face he changed damn i havent watch you in 1 year,0
n3on no way bro x2 me makes swish and breaks my brothers ankles n3on cant even dribble,0
hes literally tripped out the whole video when you met him,0
let me remind people who are scared splitting an atom makes it blow up smacking two particles together doesnt make explosions it makes fusions,0
everything applied causes side effects,0
ooops pushed again into another alternate dimension i wonder what this one will be like,0
damn this man is sharp for his age my granddad bless his soul only got to live to the age of 79 and in his last 3 years he deteriorated to such a degree that he couldnt function at all it was sad to witness sir penrose is 90 now almost 91 and he talks about stuff in a very clear way which most adults arent able to do amazing,0
the fact that n3on calls everyone poor but he always wears the default in fortnite,0
if anyone wanted to see something cursed here it is faze n3on,0
bruh neon freaks out when gets a good gun imagine how he acts when he gets vbucks,0
the way how the rich kid kept closing his eyes and making extpresions will making threats just made me cringe ,0
“rich kid” me he can’t even afford a coach to teach him how to build,0
just as i’m getting frustrated with my chemistry and math this semester this podcast pops up perfect timing lex it’s time to get my fight back,0
i really think this would ruin the minecraft experience completely if it was added in but for a mod its pretty cool,0
you are a life saver i got stuck with a pretty bad teacher and literally wouldve failed my exam if it wasnt for you,0
the audio is pulled from a talk given by susskind at uc berkeley search for it on youtube and you’ll find it not sure why this channel doesn’t cite that talk in the description they’re just repackaging sound bites with impressive graphics,0
you know when someone is worth little if people talk about what he researches not what he accomplished or what his research accomplished everyone is constantly researching life just by living it but we dont give a shit unless you manage something useful and so is with this guy just very unremarkable,0
computer science has to be treated like all the other science based subjects such as physics chemistry or biology its a shame most schools dont take cs as a serious subject,0
now i know that programming cant be learn in 8 minutes,0
and so it begins procrastinating on my actual studies to learn something different from crash course,0
my code works i have no idea why my code doesnt work i have no idea why,0
its odd that everyone knows college is nearly useless yet every business requires you to have it just to be considered for an interview,0
the little girl blew her cover so early in her career,0
i think that’s what i’m most afraid of – getting internships early i’m currently a freshman in college majoring in cs and i have little to no knowledge about coding so when i try to apply for internships i’m afraid that these jobs that an intern does will involve hacking amazon’s database or something wild,0
right when i got into my first cs class in college i was expecting to learn a bunch of programming languages but in reality we just learnt only the concepts and wrote a 10 line program in c for two days and never did any other programming that first cs class made me hate cs because the material was way too quick i started reading the first 3 chapters while taking detailed notes of every paragraph and then it got too overwhelming since i was spending nearly 10 hours for each chapter just taking notes each week i didn’t have enough time so i stopped reading the textbook all together and started to hate it because i was just memorizing the concepts without actually understanding their uses i understood how they worked but not at all their applications my advice read the textbook briefly and don’t read every word so that you won’t become overwhelmed and stop reading all together,0
one of the biggest things people should take into consideration if they’re gonna pursue any it jobs or anything related to cs is that it never ends you’ll constantly be trying to keep up with the latest tech or wondering if you need to bring getting the newest comptia cert or if your current if good enough it’s a rough life especially if you’re married or in a relationship it’s just constantly hours in front of the screen,0
oh my god thank you for clearly explaining how each logic gate is physically represented in an electrical circuit a lot of that abstraction makes it really daunting and hard for dummies like me to get it through our thick heads,0
i love how people have interships in big companies like microsoft google etc and in my country there’s no companies like those i live in venezuela a very poor country i only want to have my degree and get out of this shithole,0
i’m an excs and mathstats student who actually just switched his double major to actuarial science and mathsstats the reason being was because i found out that cs is only about 30 programming the rest of it is theory of cs and various other theoretical mathrelated cs courses like advanced algorithms and theory of computation which i’m personally not interested in if you really don’t find a lot of interest in algorithms data structures and theory of cs as viable as it is this major may most probably not be for you if you love programming but don’t find the indepth cs stuff interesting i’d encourage you to instead selfteach programming or go through a coding bootcamp computer programming is only a tool in cs like math is a tool in physics,0
i actually dropped out of cs the first time around i had no idea what i was getting myself into lol i stomped it later in life though ,0
imposter syndrome is so real i think that ties back in a lot to your first question all of us out here have imposter syndrome because we dont realize everyone else is working so hard,0
hi first of all great video i’m a freshman in my second semester of computer science and i’m kind of struggling i definitely feel the imposter syndrome and i want to practice more but i’m not sure where to look i’ve only learned a bit of java so far and i was going thru leet code and couldn’t really find anything for java do u have any recommendations,0
i’m kinda undecided on my major i’ve thought about optometry but i don’t want to do 8 years of school my mom and dad are software engineers but it’s never really been my passion do you think a cs degree is worth it like especially with jobs and stuff after graduating are you able to still enjoy or have free time,0
000 intro 049 your classmates arent better or worse 151 focus solely on your coursework 307 coffee question 418 join a club 505 attend hackathons 606 learn computer science terminology 718 dont cram or procrastinate 851 dont buy a book unless you need it 928 outro i know you took my job but here i m,0
in a room with 27 people can everyone shake hands with 9 people no theres a pandemic,0
if you play the video at 5 speed he seriously sounds like a valley girl with an attitude,0
the less people going into computer science the more the people calling me a genius,0
i think shes talking about software engineering education not computer science education math is an integral part of computer science because math is the language of science if you took math from computer science by definition you took science out of computer science which is quite bizarre,0
although she’s wrong about the math part i definitely believe that professors like to make learning cs harder than it should be,0
update i switched my major to mathematics i guess cs was not for me xd,0
its 2019 theres no way youre bad at computers youve clearly never worked in tech support,0
im a first year cs student at a major german university and my current classes are introduction to programming computer architecture automata theory calculus and linear algebra i went into it not having a background in cs at all i really only went into it because i have a thing for logic and structure and i dont regret my decision at all at the beginning i was worried because i didnt know how to code at all and i had to put in some extra hours in the beginning compared to the kids who have been doing this since they were in infant but its totally possible,0
there is a small mistake at 415 you would need to connect every point on a column with every other point on the same column same for the rows otherwise a graph coloring algorithm wouldnt work here since graph coloring algorithms only test for the constraint that each neightbor has a different color,0
i did my undergrad in computer science and im finishing up my ms in computer engineering it always drives me nuts when people ask what i do and then assume either is just programming or software engineering i try to explain it like this computer science is centered around mathematicscomputational science and problem solving developing algorithms and optimization programming is just a means of applying mathematics and problem solving techniques to problems computer engineering is focused on the development and design of computer systems i always get a reaction to my code from the guys that took computerelectrical engineering as undergrads because they generally speaking are simply trying to make x thing work and i am trying to make x thing run as efficient as possible you can take several different paths to become a coder but theres very different mindsets developed across the different disciplines anyone looking at going to school for computer science should understand this you are learning to be a problem solver first coding is secondary anyone can learn to code but being a master problem solver is what will set you apart in life and your career if you go down this path you are going to be doing far more math than coding and at the end your undergrad you will realize you barely learned how to code you will have to spend countless hours after graduation learning coding concepts libraries and frameworks but those problem solving skills are what will allow you to put all of that to use i hope this helps someone understand what they are getting into,0
my brain hurts and my decision to watch 20 of these at 1am is still not regreted,0
it completely blows my mind that we can build all of this much less make it the microscopic size we do,0
after 3 years of studying computer science ive realised its not the right major for me unrelated to this quiz got 3 points btw maybe i should have taken this quiz 4 years ago ,0
pspace problems common in planning are arguably harder as tsp is only nphard,0
this is for some of you incoming freshman who may be worried about cs if u have never coded before i was a freshman data science major last year and i had never written a single line of code i got a c in my intro to java course and i was very disappointed as it was something i really want to pursue i was worried about my performance in the next course software 1 and if my grade would be lower i worked on my own projects to better understand the logic and i ended up finishing with an a in the next course and this was all over the course of one winter break now i’m making apps with swiftui and solving data science machine learning problems in python and this was all over the course of a year don’t be afraid if you struggle early on it’s a part of the journey,0
my advice as someone who just graduated with a cs degree and was also a peer tutor is to take the time to do your work and understand the code that youre writing too many times i see people slap shit together and then wonder why it doesnt work,0
the reason sooo many fear and fail at math is not because it is hard it is because they treat it like the other basic education subjects think differently and know that you cannot succeed at math by studying night before remembering a few equations like dates in history class nor by just scrapping by office hours are the key to succeess yes but even more important than that you must complete all homework when due and dont ever give up on a single problem then you must practice practice don’t study only practice that way you don’t just know you have complete understanding about concepts much like pointing out a particular color in the room you should practice until you can look at any series of alpha numeric characters and be able to identify what it is asking and instantly knowing like identifying red letters s t o p means stop how to approach the problem and what equation formula etc to use tools in a toolbox baby,0
i cant understand why some areas look genuinely breathtaking then others are just floating disjoined rails and walls i dont understand how theres such a massive difference,0
the fact that the version of re7 that came out was considered marketings worst nightmare shows you that listening to marketing people is a foolish idea when it comes to creative endeavours,0
whenever i see a company announce a release date i never take it seriously anymore and almost expect there to be a delay,0
questions does the drm appy to anything played on the switch or just some upcoming titles do i need an internet connection to play on the switch im always connected so i had no idea this might be the case will drm make the switch unusable in another console generation or two,0
this is part of why i stick with the older consoles all these servers network logins and drm stuff just ruins gaming for me i just like popping the game in and playing,0
it will probably not be an online check drm i saw a flash of a website in the video on emulation piracy drm denuvo probably thinks that they have a way for a game to be able to run a check to see if its running in an emulated environment based on their history using kernelmode drm anticheat bs on the pc i would avoid any switch game running anything from denuvo,0
the thing with drm like denuvo is that it literally pushed piracy more ive had a couple of friends with re 8 on pc that literally got the pirated version downloaded just cause it performs 100x better and for me personally i bought the ultimate version of dying light 2 i really enjoyed it but i had to lower settings cause i thought my pc couldnt handle it or something but then i tried out the cracked version and then all of a sudden the game runs like butter i hate denuvo and if used frequently on switch it will ruin games and even trust from the fanbases,0
its also worth noting that the primary assumption behind drm is that people that would pirate a game if theres no drm would legally buy the game if theres drm thats a really absurd assumption most people that are actually doing the pirating would otherwise not buy the game at all so their piracy has a net zero impact on the developer and drm gets cracked in only a few months so the pirates need only wait anyway drm does only one thing and thats punish the people that legally buy the game,0
the eff is what i said immediately denuvo does not stop piracy it kills game performance,0
thats exactly what switch games need something to hinder the performance and bog stuff down brilliant,0
with the amount of people obsessed with nostalgia these days no one will actually be nostalgic in a few years,0
nostalgia is a very personal thing that being said i dont ever see myself being nostalgic for nintendo switch sports,0
a note for your souldiers revisit while the patch fixed a lot of the worst issues the fire temple a late game area is still prone to a lot of crashing when saving at dragon swords it was 5050 every time i saved in that dungeon whether it would crash or not didnt get any crashes anywhere else so im not sure why that area specifically is so problematic it was also an area where one room in particular had a game breaking performance bug before the big patch,0
there’s so many things that annoyed me about this game and i ended up quitting well before completion i really like games with tight responsive controls where you can learn techniques to have complete mastery over your character’s move set this game was like the opposite to that ,0
i nearly got 100 completion with this game had to stop after more than a couple of side quests had a weird performance issue where it would stutter beyond belief it took a lot of patience but if you could finish the quest the stuttering stopped it was frustrating usually they were quests where you had to find things that were all around a planet so you had to traverse large areas trying to do so when every input took several seconds to respond was too much for me now im stuck on some backlog games so i dont know if ill ever have 100 completion but maybe one day,0
the only bad thing about this song is that it ends,0
malheureusement cest toujours les mêmes promos et les mêmes prix cest soulant a la longue sur le ps store les prix sont gonfler pour faire croire a un eventuel promo il y a 1 mois metro exodus gold edition a 999 euro et la le jeu seul a 1049euros,0
on parle trop de sony et peut de microsoft ,0

hmm id still go with the steam deck this is more expensive and looks like it performs worse the only thing going for it is the oled screen plus i think the steam deck will last longer with its powerful hardware and valves continued support plus im not sure how to feel about aya neo they release a new console every 6 months which makes me question their dedication to support in the long run and they were way too expensive and probably only brought the price down on this new one because of the steam deck edit should probably finish watching the video before writing a comment because you said pretty much everything i said haha,0
honestly that tricolour three team mode was what sold the game to me its just a shame that its limited to splatfests only i felt like as a mode that was the truly unique and franchisepushing idea of a mode that warranted a whole sequel oh well i guess nintendos servers wouldnt be able to handle it at the moment this is just what splatoon 2 should have been back in 2017 to me splatoon really needs to evolve beyond the first game in quite tremendous or advanced ways in order to actually feel like a true sequel the tricolour mode was close to that principle but alas its only limited to splatfests otherwise stay fresh is just a quote of sheer irony because splatoon has thus far to me not proven to stay fresh,0
the card slot is way harder to open on the oled sucks for people like me with short fingernails never had this issue with the original so its baffling as to why they changed it,0
1997 legendary pokemon are elusive to find and even more difficult to catch usually only obtainable after finishing the main game nonstop rumours about dubious methods for how to obtain them underneath trucks etc 2022 vvvvrrroooommmmm,0
lets not deny this guys despite the wii u being a huge commercial failure it had a great library of games its a huge shame the console itself didnt do very well,0
when i was a kid i used to think you were cool when he was a kid you could bludgeon 12 people to death with each individual peice of first party hardware and itd still work fucking flawlessly consoles handhelds controllers carts that shit was made of nokium it did not break the number of times i threw a controller playstation you could only throw that once they were always the most sensitive xbox until the xbox one you could abuse that shit for five ten years and still see it work when you werent seeing red rings nintendo literally murder people with their gear it did not give a fuck,0
apparently its because theyre cheaply made the parts in the joysticks are apparently fairly fragile and the buttons are suboptimal shoulder buttons are reported to give out because of poor soldering and lack of reinforcements theres also an issue with wiring as the button and the r button are wired together while the opposite joycon is wired regularly in other words the joycons while the optimal method to play the switch in its entirety are poorly designed for their tasks,0
“you know when i was a kid i used to think you were cool” this applies to so many companies and people who turned out to be terrible i’ve honestly lost count,0
friendly reminder that the underpayed and overworked customer support nintendo staff is not in fact the one that is in charge of the design of the joy cons nor the culprit of nintendos greedy practice be civil demand your rights but respect the poor human at the other side of the phone,0
from my experience my drifting issues have largely been caused by dust blowing into the stick with compressed air or using alcohol to clean them appears to do a pretty decent job at fixing the issue still bullshit that we have to deal with this though and not everyone is as lucky as i am and may need to get their stick repaired,0
as a oled switch owner i have to say that it’s a great list but i’d include switch sports and mario party superstars in the honorable mentions those are the type of games that makes the nintendo switch be different than any other consoles in the market the local multiplayer of this little thing called nintendo switch is nasty,0
downloading the dlc from nso feels a little confusing so maybe they just got too many complaints or questions about it plus dlc on nso is a key part of the benefits so they just want to have it covered my take,0
the problem is its not telegraphed well to the general user that they have access to the mario kart tracks for example they need to upgrade their ux and put it in the switch online section of the os and also message it better my guess when i saw this was that they can see loads of people arent taking advantage of downloading dlc as part of their sub,0
after going through and seeing the user interface the download button is not as prominent as the proceed to purchase button is obvious i can see people hitting the purchase button thinking that will get them to where they need to go but then they see that they have to pay for it and get frustrated i have some experience with uxui design so that stands out,0
12709 ehh this line was pretty dumb the game engine unity has nothing to do with how the game feels when controlling my apologies for this one,0
this isnt the nintendo i grew up loving yeah because you werent paying attention back then easily your most cutting line to date,0
i really respect how scott is a big nintendo fan but isnt fooled and pledging blind allegiance to them for nostalgias sake so many of the decisions they make can be so blatantly anti consumer and it blows my mind how some fans will hop in the line of fire to block any shots sent nintendos way being extra dramatic and hardheaded no matter how egregious their actions may be,0
the fact that balan wonderworld and breath of the wild came out 4 years apart and both cost 60 makes me unbelievably sad,0
the fact this came from kotaku means it cant be taken serious,0
soo let me get this straight a person that refuses to reveal their identity 1 point tells a very fishy story 1 point without any proof 1 point for a joke that wasnt even sexual harassment 1 point then she revealed her tragic story to kotaku 1 point yeah no lmao i cant even take this seriously,0
you don’t get to say stray is a racist game and have me take you seriously one of innumerable examples if people really are doing criminalinappropriate things at work then punish them accordingly but until someone with a shred of integrity reports it i will withhold judgement,0
if she thinks a couple of inappropriate jokes over the course of 9 years is a harrowing experience she must live a very sheltered life,0
someone making sexual jokes about fictional characters in a chat is not sexual harassment its not even directed at her she wants it to be harassment specifically because shes a woman who was part of the chat,0
oh kotaku a very very “reliablecredible” source of information with no activist agenda nor creating drama to mine click or dehumanizing gamers doesn’t kotaku have an axe to grind with nintendo,0
perfectly said i’ve been bringing up stuff like this for years and i absolutely despise this double standard you can love their games all you want i certainly do but nintendo as a company is seriously one of the worst in the industry stop discounting everything they do just because you have good memories of them this needs to be fixed not just at nintendo but everywhere,0
when i was a kid in the early 90s you could still write a sloppy hand written 4 page letter with crayon drawings and send it to nintendo of america and they would immediately write you back answering every single question you had no matter how dumb it was and complementing your crappy drawings in detail i think my dad might still have some of their response letters in his desk those days are long gone,0
you’re 100 right everyone has to decide for themselves how serious this stuff is but at the end of the day there’s a lot of virtue signalling going on also while we’re at it let’s all admit that as much as people like to hate kotaku at least they’re willing to report this kind of stuff,0
here’s a hot take most hardcore gamerstech workers who would in “nerd” stuff are going to be a bunch of socially awkward weirdos this is why these things happen at all gaming companies and places like gencon where they virtue signal but these virtue signalers are the ones who commit assault andor harassment ,0
i like nintendo games but not people who commit sexual harassment which happens in too many places men and women do act in unsolicited ways towards others,0
this is the same guy that said a screen protector is useless,0
its was like i was in space so they dont work because there is no sound in space,0
reminder this was the same guy that said that a charging portable stand is useless because the switch has a kickstand,0
a fan for your switch is useless haha heres a dust cover,0
ps fanboys game pass is full of fodder that no one wants to play also ps fanboys cant wait for life of p,0
i doubt well get any new announcements anytime soon and i dont really care about indie games theyre all kind of the same to me they just look different most of the time and about pc feel like they should work more on xbox and not pc and i have pc but thats me,0
xbox says “game pass is the future… because we have it”…then “exclusives are doomed… because we have less than none”,0
considering how well nintendo exclusives sell on all their hardware and especially so on the switch i find phils comments laughable,0
i have had a love hate relationship with console exclusives i get why they exist and why they draw consumers to a specific platform this coming phil along xboxs track record concerning their exclusives since around 2013 and up havent exactly been praised as playstations have been this is more corporate weasel words xbox has cannibalized and quite frankly wore out their once golden franchises halo gears of war umim sure im forgetting some others the line is going to get blurry with where titles between the respective console manufactures games end up for consumption xbox has doing really well with game pass but they are missing that killer app for the system,0
if i were the viewer who sold this to you i would be crying right now as a hobby repairman it surprises me how many times i buy something broken and its just dirty or unplugged baffling really,0
man that dude got scammed such a simple fix how do repair shops like that even exist,0
working on railways messing around with circuits for a living i hate troubleshooting when its something simple weve just overlooked last fault i had that i was there for fixing was literally a diode being the wrong way round cost 4 fuse hand tracing and belling all the connection points before finally we found the diode was the wrong way round 2 hours later its always the last thing you check love seeing this kind of content when its an easy fix,0
malheureusement cest toujours les mêmes promos et les mêmes prix cest soulant a la longue sur le ps store les prix sont gonfler pour faire croire a un eventuel promo il y a 1 mois metro exodus gold edition a 999 euro et la le jeu seul a 1049euros,0
on parle trop de sony et peut de microsoft ,0
ac odyssey un des meilleur assassin’s creed ,0
this looks absolutely ridiculous im all for it,0
as someone i used to work for gamestop my advice is to always buy the used system over the refurbished ones the refurbished ones were broken at one point and whoever fixes them doesnt do a great job,0
i was a manager at electronics boutique 20 years ago and we had the same problem with the ps2 “company refurbs” and they usually didn’t operate i told my staff to unpack them when they came in immediately mark them as defective and ship them back out we had gotten burned too many times and i wasn’t gonna put my customers through that anymore,0
i worked at gamestop for 5 years and that is by far one of the most unacceptable packing jobs i’ve seen the first console you opened was likely in terrible shape when it was traded in it’s common for those refurbished ones to have panels replaced or be opened up and fixed from the inside out i bet it’s missing the rubber pieces on the bottom because it’s been resurfaced in some way the second console was likely just a trade in tested by an employee for under 5 minutes with these consoles very little is done before they’re repackaged and sold,0
i used to work at gamestop and i can say they didnt give us enough packing supplies to ship out orders,0
there is no loop hole for how death stranding made it to game pass pc as some have already commented 505 owns the pc rights so theyre free to put it on anything they want sony owns the console rights to ds so this is why it will probably never come to xbox consoles unfortunately,0
me mastering that cooking game in hours also me still sucking to cook in real life,0
thrift shop cashier what are you doing with all this random unrelated junk martina my goals are beyond your understanding,0
getting blamed for unrelated issues sucks but sometimes karma does work especially in the automotive industry being a technician for example someone will come for a multiple cylinder misfire and when all sorted youll now be blamed for the rear passenger windows not working ಠ︵ಠ,0
more over alex exposing us to a lead solder smell and grinding dust,0
i really don’t understand people that argue over which systems better i’m into videogames not companies that don’t even know i exist except as a number for sales i have and will continue to have any xboxps and nintendo loyalty to any of those is ridiculous trust me guys they care about your money not your loyalty,0
if there is truly a way i can play marvels spiderman 2 on my xbox series s when it comes out i wont save up for a ps5 cause i lowkey dont want to work so hard to an over priced ps5 for pretty much one game,0
she isnt a bad mom to do that lots of kids think that they can be an epic gamer and earn tons but the sad truth is that life is unfair,0
and this is why i don’t show my brother dhar mann videos,0
gaz is spot on in regards to xbox marketing it is an xbox problem and their marketing in many european countries is either nonexistent or incredibly limited they have a good product with a good service and software yet in many europeans markets they are being outsold 101 because they either dont know how or where to market their product or their budget is super limited,0
the reason the digital and physical games cost the same is because the retail stores thru a fit if people could buy the digital game cheaper the stores would be stuck with the disks,0
when a game says their new game is bigger than their last game the people whining saying a bigger map means the game wont be dense are just complaining to complain they do not know shit if the game is more dense or not that is just a deflection of an actual reaction or thought with any real substance i guess i am just sick of these people who are sick of studios being proud of making their games bigger than their previous if the game is not out or being played by reviewers at least then lets just be patient and wait until we are playing it instead of saying some bs comments are are being made up out of complete guesses pretty much i truly like how gaz does not hold back on any side playstation or xbox n will tell it how it is that is refreshing but him bitching about the red fall map when he didnt even watch the new 21 minute video the studio put out plus their was some new shit being show so i dont even know what colt was complaining about that arkane did not show anything new in the video when they had the chance to or whatever he was saying,0
in your own words do i really want an xbox no do i really need an xbox no but i feel like i work hard and i deserve it in reality since the day you stepped onto the xbox series platform you have been trying to convince yourself that you need something you didnt really want thats foolish logic the next time you dont want something dont buy it because you think you work hard and deserve it,0
i wonder if i killed the unboxing experience for myself after watching every single unboxing and review on youtube lol,0
man put batteries in the wrong way,0
this is ridiculous does sony not understand the deal is going through no matter what it’s business playstation does it all the time,0
i personally like that xbox is being so aggressive i got tired of them playing nice a long time ago especially considering that sony has never extended to them the same courtesy,0
the part at 500 explains it clearly this is why i have such a huge problem with sony right now the sense of entitlement and pettiness coming from them is infuriating seems like this is all about gamepass and other moves by ms changing the industry and now sony is upset because they have to compete on more even ground and are resentful about it,0
boy that escalated quickly i mean that really got out of hand fast – ron burgundy,0
on the series x i hate how if you have a enhanced game saved somewhere other than the internal or the hard drive for the back it will always want too update the same games over and over,0
still cant believe sony is crying over games going to xbox gamepass you cant make this stuff up,0
its about the cash tencent makes more revenue annually than both xbox and nintendo combined and they make zero exclusives and saying you pay more to support the devs is like saying youre glad to pay more at the gas pump so you can support exxon and the people working at the refineries its so dumb,0
sony had a 26 drop in software sales and had to lower sales expectations for 2022 they arent even supporting the developers themselves,0
the only negative i’ve had with streaming a game is the image quality can be quite lacking some games look better than others tho you can’t beat downloading every graphic related file,0
one very unrelated subject that annoys me even though i would love that every game had the play anywhere feature i get microsoft can’t really force third party companies like ubisoft to jumó aboard they make a lot of money from people having to rebuy the same game but atleast there should be a way to keep your progress i jumped from xbox series x to a mega high end pc build and i have lost every single bit of progress i had in every gamr,0
if you were concerned about the loss of ownership with regards to software and game pass type services the streaming game service should terrify you streaming service makes sure that only the provider controls your content,0
lets look at this from a consumer point of view paying developers a fee for timed exclusive is one thing no big deal thats just how the business is obviously you need a reason for customers to want to buy your console but for sony to intentionally go out of there way to essentially bribe multiple 3rd party developers to block a game ever going to gamepass and to ensure the customer continues to pay full price on there platform instead because they know they cant compete with it is about as anti consumer and monopoly driven as you can get and they have the nerve to call the activition deal harmful to the gaming industry  talk about the pot calling the kettle black  sony has no answer to gamepass there whole business model is about making mass profits out of there customers and making them think they cant go anywhere else this is simply sony running scared and trying to limit the damage to the profits they are inevitably going to lose from cod but i guarantee if sony were big enough of a company to buy activition themselves they would have done it in a heartbeat and you bet your bottom dollar they wouldnt leave cod multiplatform its apparently one rule for everyone else but completely another for sony  hypocrisy at its best,0
pretty scummy on sonys part on this one the game wars are always fair game tactics until you do practices that deliberately sabotage the competition ms doesnt need the console exclusivity as game pass is on pc as well so they just want those subsriptions,0
i understand if you pay for exclusive games on your platform then it should not be on your competitor subscription service but blocking 3rd party multi platform games is shitty,0
i didn’t even know gamepass had more potential until i learned that they are preventing it from having a lot of games ugh it used to be ridiculous to think that dvd blue ray would stop being a thing when videos went to netflix hulu and etc but i think that’s the future of social media anyways just my opinion,0
its quite obvious to me that sony fears microsoft thats why they keep blocking games from going to xbox what the heck is wrong with a game coming out to all consoles so that everyone can play grow up sony and mind your own business model and not what someone else is doing,0
i really wish they would beef up the storage on the s for its current price a 1tb xbox x is the same price as an s with a 1tb expansion makes it way less appealing granted you end up with a little more storage that way but also less capability in the s overall i feel if it wasnt for the whole world collectively crapping itself over the last couple yrs last gen would have already been put out to pasture as it stands theres not enough current gen owners to pull that trigger yet so games have this half in half out feel hopefully production ramps up for ps and xbox so we can leave last gen behind,0
its pretty ridiculous that microsoft is looking towards upgrading systems especially with it being hard to get the new consoles now neither company should be focused on pro consoles until the series x and ps5 have been out and have reached their full potential,0
i feel you on the cost of the pro series controller i have one of the series 1 pro controllers which i bought used and frankly i was disappointed that after i had been using it a while the rubber on the sides began to warp and peel i had to buy third party replacement parts to swap out the little plates right there because xbox doesnt offer their own replacement parts which i find kinda lame considering the rubber warping was a fairly common issue to be honest i would prefer if they had an option to buy it with the plastic plates rather than the rubber ones cause that issue isnt going to go away after using the controller for an extended amount of time the paddles are nice and all but i can buy like 3 games for the cost or i can buy a third party controller from scrub for less and get the same functionality out of it but hey to each their own what i would really love is the ability to make a custom pro controller in their design lab i would pay extra for that but as it stands right now ill stick with my standard series x controller ,0
if an elite series 3 controller is on the horizon microsoft really needs to focus on quality control i went through 3 series 2 controllers before giving up and getting a refund i experienced faulty paddles loose buzzing rumble motors and worst of all large deadzones on the analog sticks i really wanted to love it but i couldnt warrant spending that kind of money on a controller with basic functionality issues,0
not even 300 frames per second can save the plot,0
shame elite is going away just invested about 8 hours this week got up to a t9 hauler decked out with a tier fsd just wary about throwing any money at the devs after they pulled the rug out from under console players discontinuing console development,0
more ram being allocated to game devs is nice but it doesn’t solve one of the biggest issues of the series s which is the bandwidth of the memory itself also more ram doesn’t really mean higher frame rates but higher quality textures or assets or increase the distance before you see lod culling it isn’t going to affect frame rate by going from 30 to 60 but it might allow a stuttering inconsistent 30 fps to hold a more locked 30 fps,0
man ryan takes forever to get to the point,0
i’m a little disappointed that calisto protocol is gonna be crossgen it’s understandable because it’s been in development for a while,0
as a woman i love this video something felt so off this phase i couldn’t put my finger on it and you explained it perfectly its so insulting for both sexes that what they’re doing is saying that men have to be so stupid and useless in order for women to be strong and smart,0
the thing that irks me the most is substituting good storytelling and characters for the sake of filling quotas i love seeing diversity it’s a wonderful thing but it shouldn’t come at the expense of someone else or be shoehorned in for the sake of representation just write good stories and good characters it’s remarkably simple,0
it’s always awesome when someone calls you sexist for not liking she hulk the cgi looks terrible the marvel humor is painfully unfunny and i’m getting lectured because of my genitalia but yes i’m not watching it simply because it has women in it you hit the nail on the head when it comes to representation nobody cares about the character’s identity people only get annoyed when the actors directors and studios start sucking themselves off and act like they’re mlkj’s successor it’s also annoying cuz they flat out refuse to market minority actors in certain countries then turn around and call you an ist for criticizing their product same thing with their messages sure there are some good messages like choosing love and don’t be racist but they do a terrible job of conveying them also i don’t think a corporation that’s constantly getting accused of discriminating against race religion gender ethnicity panders to intolerant international consumers has celebrities attack others for disagreeing with them does business with oppressive governments and films at concentrate camps can talk to people about love and tolerance,0
as an asian who was actually born and brought up in asia i had never felt issues watching western shows and their flawed representation i mean if i want to watch a local movie i would just watch one from my own country as there is no way americans can portray my country and my people better than ourselves this is until i am being lectured about how representation works and how happy i should be watching americans try to act in various races that totally misrepresented them i mean seriously you are telling me your representation of chinese is representing all the worlds chinese that is patronizing as hell because i can tell you there are so many differences between american chinese china chinese and other chinese living in different parts of the world crazy rich asians just made me cringe so hard yes i am from singapore i believe no way home would be the last good mcu movie for a long time ever if not forever tried to watch dr strange 2 but felt like they killed the original dr strange and replaced him with a fake if you want a good representation movie in recent times try everything everywhere all at once great representative movie not because they checked the boxes but their background is actually part of the story showing the struggles the characters experienced due to their background plus the conflict between their cultural background and their current life i mean they even represented rocks who else can top it,0
it sucks how they’ve treated the characters we love so much with such disrespect and replaced them with toxic characters  spiderman is one of my favorite heroes in marvel and honestly like you said these new characters lack any character growth and as such i don’t feel emotionally attached to them or find them even a little bit relatable or likeable i just don’t care about these new movies or shows featuring these toxic characters also i just discovered your channel and i love your content ,0
im infinitely better at controlling my anger than you bruce abused as a child loses women he loves including nat chased by the military his entire life and forced into hiding lives in fear of transforming and murdering innocents actually attempts suicide jennifer sometimes i get catcalled,0
“evil cannot create anything new they can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have invented or made”,0
“i control my anger infinitely more than a repressed man who was abused as a child chased by military and had his entire life love and career ruined by an accident that produced a giant rage monster” well done writers,0
the only words i can use to describe how i am feeling right now are “i am groot”,0
there are not nearly enough episodes in this series groot deserves more,0
i never thought that this movie will be made without chadwick boseman and it still feels incomplete but now nothing can be done about it ill watch this movie for the man who left his legacy behind in this world went for eternity rip chadwick boseman our black panther forever wakandaforever,0
i thought this was a show oh my god that gave me a heart attack,0
you know wong is the most underpaid actor in mcu because they put him in everything,0
lágrimas nesse trailer e principalmente na imagem do chadwick ,0
i still feel kinda bad for thor he lost everything because of thanos hela and malekith his brother mother father and brother friend are all dead,0
this trailer felt so promising cant believe how daft the actual movie is by comparison,0
christian bale as gorr looks terrifying love it,0
its like watching a whole new god of thunder it doesnt feel like watching thor because hes so serious and in this he is taken to a joke,0
unfortunately i wasn’t able to make it live but i do have a question how do you resolve shadows of the past with phoenix it seems a waste to have this restrainedunrestrained status mechanic only to have sotp say just forget all that,0
she hulk “im better at controlling my anger because i control my anger infinitely more than you i control my anger when im catcalled in the street and when toxic men explain my job to me” do the writers even know bruce banner at all or do they just look at him as “a man that gets angry and turns green and big” because that line of dialogue was ridiculous bruce banner was abused as a kid watched his father figure beat his mom to death bruce tried to off himself and failed bruce has to live with the fact that hulk took control of his body and mass killed innocent people in avengers 2 absolute ridiculous writing,0
hulk has fought aliens monsters been sent into space been in battles taken on thanos forced into hiding had a split personality and has been hunted and attacked by the military but shehulk was sort of cat called by three guys outside a bar and her boss did some mansplaining early in the episode so her life is in her words infinitely more stressful than real hulk this show is making feminism seem more ridiculous not less also smart hulk sucks aaron american,0
i adore tatiana shes easily one of the best actors currently working between her brilliant performances in orphan black or in 2020s perry mason but my god this looks pretty terrible im so bummed for her because this is the first mainstream exposure shes gotten as an actor and this looks like its shaping up to be a complete trainwreck,0
when you start telling the audience how to feel about the character see super girl e1 you have to doubt they will succeed at showing us a compelling character,0
captain america turns chair around and sits down so…you made fun of me and suffered the consequences,0
seeing those flamin hot cheetos go to waste was such a heart wrenching moment for me,0
“oh ok so this must be some jerkwad driving like in doctor strange“ spaceship “what the hell” oo,0
ok that got me i was not expecting that i thought it would be some kind of a regular car accident but this is the mcu i guess,0
its heartbreaking how sad strange is when he says everyone who knows and loves you we we will have no memory of you,0
avengers endgame itself is speechless,0
“we can handle your little witch” proceeds to get destroyed with ease,0
tate after he strangles you “breathe air”,0
punches him in the stomach “should’ve aimed for the head”,0
the sound effects gets me dead more than the meme itself ,0
so how can darkhold be good in the cosmic room room 5 dr strange should never take a turn according to the passive on the room ive seen them put in that room before but it should be like 5 on 4 if you dont bring any cosmic can you please confirm this,0
the hype is not the same anymore when they announced back in the day phase 23 with infinity war and endgame these two if you search the reactions are insane,0
if i were that close to scarlett johansson i’d have all kinds of trouble with my lines,0
i think her sneaky lawyer tactics werent to find out if he was a virgin it was to find out if hes still alive she said i knew it after banner referred to him in the present tense the whole virgin thing was probably a misdirect,0
what is the title of this movie why does the ending of the movie get abruptly cut before completion the audience can’t see the message resolution,0
no its not an a or even a b rate moviethe core cpl went from being a no nothing not worried about nothing to analyzing what was going on around the world at that time and starting on a journey that i think many of us have been on for awhile i will not criticize their reactions too many people right now are right where they were at the start of this movie instead they started to oopen their eyes and see what possibilitys could happen and took the first steps into prepardness im as bad as they are about knowing my neighbers ill admit that ive lived in this house 25 years and i only know and talk to 2 of my neighbersand theres like 20 familys up here withen a mile mabey more folks instead of criticizing this film analyze it and see where you stand and how you can help others,0
for those who think life will never get this way you best be thinking about how it very much could with all the emigrants coming in with god knows what how bad things have been bad things are going getting let this sink in your head a bit,0
dont beat me in front ma kids we gon blindfold them ,0
eva looks so beautifulbut her role in this movie  is envious and jealousy she didnt want the man when he acted as blind and then when she knew that he wasnt then she wanted him her evil intentions destroyed their family,0
it soo sad but interesting,0
he always wants somebody to go with him wicked old man,0
while i generally agree with your comments about ronin the callous disregard of collateral damage shooting into crowds and causing violent vehicle accidents was a total turnoff for me they spread injury and death among innocent bystanders without any sign of care or compassion,0
this is what would happen if you gave a schizophrenic a camera and a bag of mushrooms and told them to recreate the evil dead i can feel my brain cells dying,0
oh the horror a case of corona extra dropped on the sidewalk im gonna need therapy for at least the next 10yrs,0
got bored for 30minutes i can see its a boring one so im not going to finish it,0
no story meaning less film didn’t understand a thing horribly boring my ears are burning,0
weird,0
the intro nearly caused me to cancel this movie,0
i was into this and i dont normally watch  like this kept my attentionuntil the very endwhich sucks unless you have a part 2 too many questions left unansweredi hate endings as such,0
samaritan looks like it could be quite a gem that teen wolf movie looks horrible dont worry darling the woman king are timestamped the wrong way around 4452 is the woman king 4716 is dont worry darling,0
worthless movie and screwed up sound track dont even try,0
not even the same movie and its a bunch of jocks standing in a room talking all through the movie wish there was a blocker for dopes like this channel guy,0
what a dud movie voices are out of sync and the actors if you could call them that are a typical bgrade wanna bes i give it a five turd rating out five,0
not loud enough,0
rubbish waste of time,0
interesting film but the musical interruptions completely ruin it,0
for me if only with sub i don t speak well english and wonna understand the movie,0
for me if only with sub i don t speak well english and wonna understand the movie,0
a few days ago my house was destroyed by water i am a bangladeshi brother please any body help mee,0
not even close as best action full of bs,0
you know what i cannoti repeat i cannot believe this ended this way where is the rest of the movie people ,0
i dont know what to say about this moviejust who the hell did she think she wasmayor or assassin crazy moviethey need to lock her ass up and she wont have no more evil power over anyones life,0
there isn’t a mayor in america with this much power… you can’t become acting mayor because you’re someone’s mother you can’t be the chief of police because you’re mayor… you can’t arrest people and hold them in custody for no reason… the lack of cohesion… i can’t my head hurts,0
human trafficking and sex slavery it still going on but not where i live at,0
if i ever witness a gunfight or a gun harpoon fight i wont be standing in the crowd behind one of those involved,0
never bring a gun to a harpoon fight,0
i wish someone would come up with a streaming service that includes a lot of movies from the 40s and 50s without having to pay extra for them im a big fan of classics including the likes of cary grant kate hepburn william powell etc i used to be able to watch them on youtube but theyve pretty much all been pulled because of copyright infringement,0
sad to see that in the name of entertainment we are spending so much on theater tickets that these actors are demanding 25 crores for a movie even highly educated proffesionals cas engineers doctors civil servants etc do not earn this kind of money in india after 10 year of service a simple logic if theses actors including the kumars khans devgans kapoors roshans etc start charging 10 to 50 lac per movie the theater ticket price will drop automatically and eventually we can start enjoying movie in the theaters with our families at a much lesser price these superstars have built their mansions worth 100 crores and secured the lifes of their children and grandchildren they are living kingsize life with our hard earned money i believe we better stick to ott or any other form of free entertainment which is easily available on youtube or any other app,0
who the hell is making these kind of crappy movies,0
do you ever feel like there are so many great upcoming movies but they just disappear,0
the main problem with the tiger scene in fury is that decision making although independent thinking was encouraged in the german army the choice here to take the tiger out of cover and engage on the move is a miserable decision on the commanders behalf the tiger had no gyroscopic turret so would be very inaccurate whilst moving he also has the ability to kill all of those shermans through their front armour at that range and can’t even be sure they know his exact position essentially the commander is a tool,0
in fury it infuriated me that the german tank decided to blow his cover and close the distance with the shermans the tiger had an amazing advantage but blew it all away,0
im trying so hard not to get too upset with most of these kids and their complete disrespect for some of these masterpieces at first glance because i know every generation goes through this stage its like an infuriating rite of passage,0
janelle and lucas made this video an awful watch their attitude to something they’ve never seen before is unbearable,0
the disrespect these kids had for pagemaster and the iron giant is crazy smh,0
it’s not so much the fact that they don’t know these movies that makes me mad it’s the disrespect they are showing towards the animation that gets me mad people worked hard to draw those films hand drawn animation and cell animation was tough compared to now with computer drawn animation and a lot of the animation on these movies still hold up,0
i get not knowing these movies if you literally never heard of them i get not liking the quality but janelle and lucas’ entire personality throughout this video is “let’s trash everything we see and devalue every credible thing about it” “but theyre teens” no the other teens in this video were great and open minded other teens in real life are very open minded as well these two don’t pass the vibe and i wouldn’t want to watch anything old with them,0
i’m gen z and this is just embarrassing i knew every single one of these,0
this is really a very clear presentation of what really goes with a data science project from the very beginning however things do not happen very easily there are a lot of challenges that you have to deal with in data cleaning alone the time that you use can be overwhelming,0
these are what i watch when im depressed about my career at 1am,0
i wish i saw this 6 months ago ive been trying to transition careers from physics to data science and after not having much luck despite what i thought to be very similar methods used in my former career now its becoming clear why my resume is getting nowhere ive focused on the top too much havent showcased my whole pyramid thank you bro,0
as someone who transferred from data science to data analysis i agree with every point here being in the everlasting learning process was particularly exhausting not that data analysis needs no learning but the intensity ds requires is of another level,0
those are valuable pieces of advice i always get caught going deep but my main problem is distraction i end up learning too many things,0
the biggest problem i’ve had so far is working with my manager we both have very different perspectives on various problems but he simply doesn’t even want to hear my perspective even when my perspective is usually right we are both data scientists but he graduated as a data scientist back in 2003 so he’s an old head and i recently graduated it’s very tough to get along and having your voice heard,0
im learning data science and whenever i read job descriptions for entry levels or even for interns they want you to be jack of all trades and on top of that require you to have 23 years of experience plus they include big data streamlines and ask you to be an expert on it too along with all sorts of cloud services i mean it feels like theyre demanding an intermediate data scientist and terming it as data analysis intern or junior data analyst role this frustrates me a lot,0
its really difficult to work as a data scientist because every company have different expections from data scientist and now a days a data scientist should know all the skills like computer vision deep learning operational research machine learning sql and many more there must a discrete line between data scientist work roles and also as you have mentioned interview prep it is really difficult because we need to prep from scratch — struggle of a datascientist,0
i’m a data analyst i will say you need to be good at attention to detail and actually know your skill set one wrong variable can skew your results majorly which can cost time and money i’ve had to bite the bullet before and it hurts wasting hours of your life on something that needs to be redone or straight abandoned,0
hello alex i currently hold a masters in healthcare informatics i am having trouble finding a job in my field i am wondering if i should be focusing on data scientist or data analyst i don’t have much experience when it comes to sql python etc i am wondering if i should consider enrolling in a data analytics boot camp what are your thoughts,0
working as a phd in a business school we often get hookups with companies about some data and it always shocks me how little they know id say they are very good at collecting data but they often have no idea how to use it that is if there problem is anything but a straight forward prediction problem my understanding are the best skills to have are 1 be able to identify problems 2 be able to decide how to solve the problem once that is done usually the process is just data cleaning and then running the libraries you decided on already which is fairly trivial though potentially data cleaning is time consuming but honestly dont trust me i had to go do a phd because nobody would hire me to do even the most basic stuff,0
hi tina this was really great advice about demonstrating your impact super useful for data science people but i feel like its relevant to every field too please could you do a video on how you deal with rejection im job hunting in a field thats very new to me not data science at the moment and im just so afraid of getting rejected because that could mean the end of my dream also even if it doesnt the feeling just sucks lol,0
honestly the frustrating thing for me at work as data analystscientist is i never saw our clients give any feedback about how our reports were helpful for them and change their projects aka business impact like what you described i always comfort myself that even just a little impact and thats enough,0
i feel for a local business owner who opened up a coffee shop my two sisters worked there and were very good friends with the owner since she was a teacher at the highschool and saved up enough money to open the shop up sadly during the pandemic my state nuked her businesses my sisters lost their jobs while the governor praised herself about her actions and those evil businesses were destroying our state she then proceeded to get caught twice having parties spending thousands on booze actually watched dozens of business get nuked the same way fun times fun times,0
since i was little i knew i’d rather live in the street than become a wage slave and have to relive the school experience of being told what to do having to negotiate with incompetent managers for a 5 increase every year just sounds insane to me i studied software engineering so i could build my own tools and sell them took countless 70 hour work weeks but the work does pay off now own half of a successful tech startup currently using that income to start two other companies with virtually no competition in my area in other industries i’m interested in entrepreneurship is the way made my first m at 26 currently 27,0
the sentiment is maybe coming from the difficulties to find your fist job if you are an aspiring data scientist rejection and unclear expectations most companies have no idea how to find and sort datascientists may make many believe that is was just a fad and they came a little late to the party,0
as a person who needs to deal frequently with data at my office my biggest nightmare is not getting required data from the stakeholders,0
hi priya thank you for this video i am concluding my last year as a student receiving my bs in data analytics and i have so many questions that are causing me anxiety as i am nearing the end of my journey i have realized that the path in computer science dsda is not structured like one probably imagined it would be what i am wondering is if you encountered the same during your journey in terms of learning these program tools python sql tableau r if what’s important while in school is getting a basic understanding of these tools and how to use them but the real challenge starts after graduating in teaching yourself on how to use these tools more effectively to actually be able to draw meaningful insights did you have to hone your skills a bit more once you graduated before you started to apply to jobs i have beginner level on all these programs right now but i feel like i probably won’t be able to land a job in data analytics until i’m at least intermediate in sql and at least python for starters i would appreciate your feedback and would also love to connect with you offline to chat if possible congratulations again on your journey and your role in data science,0
1000 this is an extremely hard coding task it deals with a custom datatype implies the iteration and verification of the end i wasted 40 minutes and didnt resolve it all the solutions i have found include flattering with a separate method than iterating and len verification and the task is formalized in a way that next and hasnext methods should be enough to do the flattening which is again more difficult i am not sure if it is a suitable task for a middle software developer in a fortune500 company coding interview comparing this with the explanation of the gradient descend is like chalk and cheese,0
thanks man for clearing this up especially in india all it companies have made a mess about data jobswhy dont you make a video dscussing these jds especially from india these all are mncs,0
game dev in my head im gonna make a hyper realistic level with amazing movement combat and an adaptive ai game dev in reality help ive imported a mesh and crashed my computer,0
preoptimisation is my biggest weakness as a sw engineer it kills a lot of passion and motivation for projects if it’s not perfect it’s very hard to correct,0
gmt dont over think or over prepare your game me with adhd and wanting to make a metroidvania style game visible sadness,0
hey man ive been building these lets call them prototypes for many years im a programmer and game designer and always wanted to be ever since a kid and been following that passion since ye old newground days but when it comes to art i just shut down im genuinely awful at the art part so ive always teamed up with artists problem is i then get bogged down with the project management aspect and art pipeline systems instead of the art that its wildly impacted my focus on the gameplay aspect and it suffers as a result eventually everyone burns out and the project peters off for something new and shiny using what weve learned i know this stupid vicious cycle well,0
and so i abused my internet fame to get someone much smarter than me to build that exact thing i just described fantastic line ,0
actually underrated,0
you still have clapped british teeth,0
fun cheats in bioshock when the player recieves lethal damage he gets a few seconds of god mode leading to more barely survived moments in gears of war the last bullet in a magazine deals 3x damage leading to more barely defended myself moments,0
not sure if its mentioned in this video but something i feel should be said in every tips video like this dont do your dream project first you will ruin it if you dont give up first,0
the tip i see missing from all of these videos is take inspiration from wide sources not just your favorite games whats the good in the game you otherwise hate what do you like about that book you just read how can you incorporate colour like they do in that movie you watched this is what they mean when they say good artists copy great artists steal when you steal something you make it your own and if you steal from a diverse set of inspirations it becomes truly yours,0
bro is giving away more than my entire net worth,0
vimlark does a game engine run on gas me no it runs on human suffering,0
you had me at i have anxiety to the point where i almost didnt go in even when i was sitting in the parking lot man do i know that feeling now try it with shortterm amnesia,0
642 anxiety to the point where i was considering not going to this meetup even when i was sitting in the parking lot of the venue i felt that hard good job making it happen,0
the same goes for all the careers and fields there are always pros and cons a riskfree life is the most dull and boring life,0
david i didnt even know how to program still dont me as a programmer story of my life,0
454 totally agree with writing readable code i just dont think and are the problem at all in my opinion if someone sees that as hard to read they should probably take a step back i think badinconsistent indentation confusing variable names repeated code and organization in general are way greater problems that beginner coders do very often,0
507 never ever do this if boolean false is horrible form if an exclamation mark is really too difficult then just use the not keyword but please dont abuse comparison operators like that,0
the fact that the second game developer was paid less than minimum wage is upsetting none of the artists were credited as well such a shame,0
the first game felt like a flash game the second felt like a full release and the third felt like one of those unity games with fun physics overall the thumbnail was not only clickbait but those 3 poor devs were definitely heavily underpaid for their work i dont think i would be happy only giving them so little money for their work and not even giving them credit either,0
opening blender for the first time is terrifying wheres the make finished 3d model button,0
i actually loled a few times watching this you perfectly described a persons first experiences with game dev and unity pretty well most peoples are worse than your experience because they have no programming experience and dont understand anything going on at all ,0
you got me in the first minute “not seeing friends i don’t have” and “looking at unity no idea what i was looking at” exactly my feeling,0
damn you were one hell of a 14 year old developer,0
yo this video has gotten a lot more views than it deserves for being as dumb and badly put together as it was so i feel like i should clear a few things up first off to game devs who are just starting out dont attempt to do exactly what i did because it probably wont work out well and im not saying this because i think im smarter or better at game dev than you in all honesty im pretty average and tons of people couldve done a lot better in my shoes but thats just the thing not everyone is in my shoes and has the same experience that i had prior to this id been making 2d games and was quite familiar with coding so carrying that over to unity and 3 dimensions was fairly simple i mentioned this in the video but ive seen too many comments in the vein of wow this was impressive i would never be able to do this which frankly makes me feel a little bad since most people probably would be able to do this if they had the same experience i had and i dont want to discourage anyone who doesnt realize this so i just wanted to reiterate that this was just a video made for shits and giggles by a guy who already knew how to make 2d games and wanted to apply that knowledge to 3 dimensions also everyone learns at their own pace in their own way and the rate at which that gets done doesnt really matter as long as youre able to learn what you needed to learn in the end within reason of course if it takes 8 years to figure out how to print hello world then we might have a problem so even if you have as much experience as i did there should be no reason to feel bad if you take more time because ultimately it doesnt really matter how quickly youre able to learn how to make games as a game developer you develop games and the quality of those games is really the only thing you should be worrying about not how quickly you can make them of course this mostly only applies if youre doing this as a hobby and if you have a deadline to meet and bills to pay you should probably worry a little more and on the other side of the spectrum to those who think this video was faked it wasnt lol as mentioned before i already knew how to make 2d games and how to program things arguably the hardest part of developing games because of that the focus of this video wasnt on that but rather applying what i knew to 3d games by learning 3d modelling animation and how to work with unity which was fairly easy and straightforward thanks to the massive amounts of documentation and resources available on the internet and such but mostly this was just for shits and giggles since i find messing around with 3d games entertaining and i feel like people may be reading into it too much lol also there are a few continuity errors that a few people have caught in the dates shown on my computers taskbar but that was caused by how i usually record clips while video editing and not when im actually making the games so i just have a weird workflow and last thing to youtube why the fuck does this have 500000 views did the algorithm break i can think of a whole lot of videos that deserve 500000 views and this is definitely not one of them so if youre watching this go watch someone elses video or something this one has way too many views already,0
this video taught me to spend way too much time on ragdolls when making a 3d game,0
hey just wondering did you use the default sessions for the multiplayer or some other plugin would be handy to know because the default sessions i think are only lan and loopback and ive tried that steam plugin but that doesnt work out great also good video,0
microtransactions are really soiling the gaming experience imo everything is quickly becoming a subscription,0
the reason triple aaa games are becoming so expensive and some are totally failing is just because they focus on tech and not on design theyre treating what were supposed to be enjoyable games as engine demos and not giving enough time to release them properly you cant just create another gta v every single year that shit takes a lot of time,0
another issue is that whenever you sink that much money into a single project the designers have to give up a significant amount of creative control business just wont allow that much money to be spent on an experiment everything ends up being the old tried and true so you end up with very samey uncreative bland games that look really nice,0
ive been telling my friends this for the past couple years we are going to see fewer aaa games because games not only have to compete with other new releases but all of the preexisting games as well there is just so much competition in this industry,0
it’s awful sad to see how stuff goes to thrash when the general public gets access look at youtube itself with its mandatory “ad friendly content” social media taking over everything lack of variety due to companies milking “winning formulas” dry game companies noticing that the casual player is not demanding quality at all… it sucks,0
that desk would’ve taken me at least 3 days to draw,0
bruh i write how to make a game engine and get a fucking adventure video,0

i dont completely agree on deep learning explanation because for weight training labelling is required yes patternfeature extraction can be debated but labelled data is required,0
this is how you teach students awesome explanations without the explanation of the fundamental terminologies as he is doing here machine learning becomes boring to learn,0
i guess you cant teach selfdriving cars using rl in the real world punishing them if they collide would be a little too late so i would guess that rl is used only in lab simulations and then later in the real world these systems are only performing the task without actively using rl do i get it right,0
also it may be wise to learn matlab to a fairly advanced level before doing ml the jump from basic python to ml is quite a big one i was not able to make that jump and got fired from my job because of it you must know how to populate matrices by row and column take the average etc a basic python course wont cover these things but matlab courses are more specific for the type of things you will be doing as an machine learning engineer or data scientist,0
hi op my question is regarding the challenge of dealing with datasets in my project the feature set contains about 40 columns from merging10 csv files to train my model but the test dataset contains just 2 columns including the target column so each time i try to make classification on the target column i get a failure notice telling me that my training and test shape are not the same how can i make my model to make prediction based on the test dataset given to me or how can i adapt my test dataset to conform to the training dataset in shape in order to run my program,0
it is not a question if ai is good or bad it is a question of using it in a good or bad way another thing is many people resist change of any type resisting change means that those people will be totally unable to cope when the change becomes everywhere,0
with great power comes great responsibility great documentary but im afraid this superpowerful technology will be used for evil purposes as well as always in human history,0
this would be substantially more terrifying if the bots werent drawn to be so cute,0
the true existential crisis comes when you realise he just described evolution in general we can recreate it we benefit from it yet we have no clue why or how its actually working beyond luck,0
when grey was talking about the warehouses and slaughterhouses all i could do was think of star wars the bots are basically equivalent to clones on kamino i would say the bots are less sentient but the way grey has depicted them makes that less certain and the comparison all the stronger,0
teacher bot cant teach but it can test did you just explain the entire american school system,0
its not always that you want an unlimited dataset in machine learning sometimes you want to limit your dataset for example if youre trying to figure out if youre in a stock market recession or expansion you dont want to go over 2 years months of data because youll end up in another cycle symmetry and domain limits are important in machine learning my point is sometimes too much data is a waste of time and resources,0
dissapointed you did not animate a 13000dimensional graph would make things easier,0
in my eyes the second con is the worst thing that can happen to you in ml in many cases i would eagerly wait for about 56 hours for the model to train to see it not work at all in the way i intended id keep training the model day after day after making small changes in the code to see its performance not getting better at all,0
the only thing holding me back is that it took about 30 mins to implement a classification algorithm with a data size of around 20 numbers on a powerful laptop it was straightforward and a lot of fun but when the size of the data increases it might go on for even a week with gpus it pays well but so does frontend development at any decent company this video didnt give any valuable inputs to make a decision,0
i will forever acknowledge this channel with the help of your lessons and ideas explanations now its quite helpful while youll just sit at your comfort and monitor your account growth,1
apple pay is so convenient secure and easy to use i used it while at the korean and japanese airports no need for physical credit cards,1
we only got apple pay in south africa in 20202021 and it’s widely accepted,1
in the united states we have an abundance of retailers that accept apple pay but its still good to carry the physical card with you being there are still a large quantity of places that do not accept apple pay,1
wow you really went to town on the psu test rack thats a serious bit of kit very flexible good choices wouldnt surprise me if choma start offering this bespoke rack to the psu makers they all watch your videos so theyll want to make sure it passes on this exact same rack you can really push the industry here well done open source the test interface hardware and software,1
the lab is the most exciting thing in it ive seen for a while this is reallly going to shake up how the qualiity of even basic components are manufactured,1
linus im an engineer and love the lmg content across all the channels very much looking forward to more lab content and hope your engineering team will get more on camera time and hosting roles,1
there used to be a time where linus was the smartest guy in the room this video clearly shows that the team he has built are experts in their respective fields and make linus look like a child kudos to linus and lmg youve grown beyond what i imagined all the best,1
i love the direction this channel is going most tech channels even the best trusted ones are going to review products based on their own experience or at most some things they can measure with their pc but youre really going to mathematically demonstrate if a product is a quality one and why it is love it,1
i am more excited for the ltt lab than i have been for a lot of content for a while now as everyone seems to be saying its exciting to see how enthusiastic this new crew is to get things running,1
i adore the working relationship linus has with his team 99 of employees walk on eggshells around their boss and i wish it could be more like this,1
lmgs growth is honestly something to truly aspire for this is the content we want to watch more technical in depth engineering oriented and sciencebased content will make us consumers much much more educated on these topics thus when picking a product not only will we pick the best choice but well know exactly why we picked it which helps greatly with buyers remorse,1
i love all the people ltt has added for labs clearly theyre knowledgeable and passionate about tech labs is gonna be killer love it,1
linus just turn the key lights 180 and bounce them off the walls you’ll get a much softer glow and shadow and way more even lighting it’s such a simple fix i’m not sure where along the lines people got the idea to beam the lights directly at your face ,1
dan continues to be my new favorite he has such an air of confidence about him and a comforting presence like dan shows up and you just know things are going to be fine,1
dan managing to set up his soldering station on the one box they needed was incredibly amusing to me,1
linus gets on his employees cases for all the stuff stolen from the office also linus proudly talks about all the stuff stolen from work hes using in his upgraded setup linus why are you using this monitor as a table also linus uses the monitor as a chair this video was hilarious,1
dan the man saving the day riley needs to give him his own theme like brian the electrician,1
dan continues to be a favourite for me hes like the incredibly patient but longsuffering dad who just gets on with things,1
dan is a treasure your channel has long lacked a mr fixit type and while i am sad its not me dan appears quite capable and funny,1
blows my mind how quickly dan became the rock upon which all things linus standslove it,1
hey linus a good trick for streaming lights bounce them off the wall much easier on the eyes and a nice softer look also for indoors id recommend a hypercardioid mic looks like a short shotgun like the audiotechnica at4053b,1
unstoppable experiments with liquid nitrogen ,1

everyone has been saying it but i’ll throw my hat in as well to any prospective college students you do not need to spend money on flagship products i am about to graduate with a business degree and have been using a 7 year old laptop and the base ipad from late 2020 both products have worked flawlessly and i have no intention of replacing them the recommendations listed are ones i would never be able to afford even with my job i’m working as well do your own research on forums to see what your peers say the best value product is i promise that if you buy a flagship product you will quickly see that you did not need it,1
shoutout to my oneplus phone and huawei laptop for getting me through university feeling premium for much less bonus ups for ikeas articulating lamps 20 and i can see all my homework incredibly well without eye strain the old door i refinished to use as a desktop and wired earbuds under hardware store earmuffs as my noisecancelling headphones and the same 2 sets of hanes underwear from target for also lasting the whole ride,1
you dont necessarily need the highend and latest tech for university i used a 2009 macbook pro throughout my years at uni had an iphone 6 and it worked out just fine whats important is to remain focused on getting that degree and graduating,1
personally i feel like this is really out of touch most students wont be able to afford these in case anyone needs it i believe dave2ds back to school video are honestly the best ones ive seen on the topic consider checking them out too before making a purchase decision,1
hey everyone good take on the video and love the recommendations if you plan on making another video such as this maybe you can also include some more budget options and best value options what i can tell from my years of studying in college and university is that your tech and needs will be based on what coursesprogramme you took for your education engineering students require computer specs that can run bim software im not sure about the other programmes but from what i can see that most students at my place has 8gb of ram for their laptops also here is my setup during my university years hope it can help anyone who are looking to buy something for their collegeuniversity years all the best laptop asus x455l upgraded to ssd with additional ram phone vivo y69redmi 10samsung a22 4g mouse logitech g102 keyboard tecware tkl ver,1
i have used galaxy tab s7 during my phd its been a lifesaver for me first of all it is really good for reading journals note taking and scribbling on the pdfs secondly it doesnt strain your eye that much when you use a computer or a laptop always at a fixed distance thirdly you get the premium version of noteshelf free with tab s7 and lastly if you are from a stem background and use a lot of illustrations or flow process diagrams you can draw those easily with the stylus on tab s7 i choose tab s7 over apple ipad air for its ease of use user interface and cost you get stylus for free with tab s7 and in most cases keyboard too with a huge student discount,1
this series is exactly what career day shouldve been such interesting and knowledgeable people,1
seasoned craft brewery tour guide here and i’m so glad he ended on “drink what you like” sometimes people get weirdly judgmental about the beer preferences of others at the end of the day there are hundreds of beer styles for a reason so everyone can find at least one style they actually like,1
this guy is a total bro not snobby at all and just wants people to enjoy beer in whatever way they want such a contrast with your stereotypical beverage elitists,1
y’all be picking the literal best professionals for these videos not only is everyone knowledgeable but they all seem passionate and eager to teach us,1
this guy has a face made for movies a voice made for radio and a great personality i wanna see more of garrett,1
i live for johns roasts of att,1
mad respect to john oliver and his team for not making us watch ads during the show major props,1
one important aspect im surprised was left out is that many of these companies like amazon literally power the internet almost 30 of the websites on the internet are stored on amazon servers giving them even more access to data trends and physical control over the internet,1
john oliver deserves an oscar for his can dolphins love you monologue,1
hey hey just a heads up i did turn the led hoodie on its just not very bright hen youre looking faceon at it you can still sort of see it on around the hood area though  if you had fun on this video heres my collection of extreme unboxing videos,1
the safety belt wouldve paired perfectly with the unicycle and those roller boot things,1
that was seriously the most enjoyable thing ive seen in awhile i forgot how rad this channel is well done sir,1
dude i love how genuine your reactions were ive had fun watching this and not only i was really interested to see what each one of those gadgets did,1
infinity dodecahedrons are seriously cool i bought another smaller one and i really enjoy it its definitely an eye catcher and a conversation starter,1
i personally enjoy the old school phones i have such a hard time hearing my iphone at max volume without the speaker on if i worked in an office i would definitely buy one people forget how ergonomic those old phones are its not particularly comfortable holding a rectangle to your head i also have physically sensitive ears so any type of headphones ear phones whatever cause me a bunch of pain looks like a good product that can both be a gag and something for people out there like me who have a tough time using a regular mobile phone,1
i have to say it after watching this video it feels like the journey youre on this year has been effective it simply feels like youre enjoying life and its what i enjoy most about watching your videos you manage to pass that joy on just the musings of a random stranger ,1
i havent laughed like this for years oh my gosh arun youve nailed this one wendi ,1
quality quality quality is everything about this channel arun makes my mood happier video after video lets be searious the best part about this channel is arun making his jokes and when he shows tech,1
the fire suppression without water was incredible it could save many lives and property especially if it could be auto activated like a heat detector imagine how much property and how many sleeping people could be saved especially if this had a built in alarm and was rigged to keep hallways clear of fire what an inventionwow,1
id really appreciate a study into the potential advantages of meta materials in manipulating light emf heat and even replacing silicon as semiconductors nearly every industry can benefit from the improvements and cost reductions meta materials can provide really enjoy your videos thank you,1
i love the one about the hydrogen fuel cellsconsidering this technology has been around for about 20 yearsjust hasnt been used due to a lack of pressure on the industry and the fact that the patent was buried by large corporate interests,1
she has a very effective way of delivering information in a way that is accessible love her,1
if the lead singer is bret michaels then im sure it is poison that had me laughing for ages ,1
anne is so cool she makes me want to reevaluate my life choices and return to college to become a toxicologist,1
poison support is one of the more interesting ones of this series im glad to see anne back in the seat and schooling us hoping for more,1
i love how she says that it is poison in the right dose instead of the wrong dose,1
marques does a fantastic job highlighting the features of the link if youre looking for the next level of webcam look no further  dope tech dope video,1
the camera is amazing and there are so many people who could benefit from it a lot,1
i’ve been playing with the insta360 link for about a week now as a college professor and edtech trainer i can tell you that this is a complete game changer for online and hybrid teaching switching from follow mode to whiteboard mode to topdown mode for demos etc is a purely magical experience,1
i honestly have to say while its still insanely expensive 3500 for that monitor isnt as bad as i was expecting and its almost reasonable like its still more than i would ever spend on a single display and im far more into having separate displays but given what its capable of the specs the tech behind it etc its not that bad i can see a few people getting real use out of something like that,1
this monitor is perfect for streaming three 27“ monitors in one is amazing  but man is it expensive ,1
i can see this being good for editing and streaming reading the chat and playing the game on one screen this is genius,1
geez i need a dedicated studio for all of this dope tech in my future,1
this has gotta be one of the best dope techs everything here is a hit that i’m def writing down for later,1
i’m always looking forward to these every month so thank you for making them honestly that little lamp and speaker caught my eye the flickering is really cool to me and the speaker is a nice extra,1
the sound test killed me that was hilarious and the wrist rest is brilliant i often get marks on my wrist from my mousepad,1
what a tough selection this month whether it be the soundbar the lamp speaker or even the pc panel display they all seem something that would really improve my set up but for me it may have to be the soundbar one looks smart has nice rgb and a decent size and price very good month of tech this month,1
i absolutely love this series all of the items were neat but the only one i would actually benefit from would be the chair wheels i have a regular office chair that has to roll on carpet and it is kind of a pain,1
that sensor panel is definitely convenient been wanting to make my own with a raspberry pi but just find myself getting off track super cool to just be able to purchase and go,1
the rgb sound bar would be perfect for my setup i’ve been using the speakers in my monitor as my main sound system so it would be a nice upgrade for me,1
i always love franks energy i also look forward to the end of every month thinking about this series i love the tiltednation soundbar and i need that for my set up,1
always great to see this series so many cool things this month my office setup could use those chair wheels,1
this series has helped me and my friends find some helpful tech that has helped our setups the pc panel is gonna be a huge upgrade,1
we need the under 100 for august as well this is the best series out there,1
been a good while since ive been a student but i still watched the vid to find out what cool gadgets are out there didnt think id be walking away from it with a productivity tip that idea of the simple timer is so good instead of devices that can also do time great vid frank,1
the desktop lamp is definitely my favorite it’s also something i’ve been looking for because i updated to a keyboard that doesn’t have shine through keycaps so it’s definitely a need too,1
i’m not a student however i always love seeing the tech always looking to change and upgrade my desk setup for work,1
fantastic video frank you always bring really cool stuff to the front that most of us havent seenheard anything about hope you and the fam are doing well xd btw that kb for only 100 i know theyve gotten a lot cheaper but hot damn i dont need it but i want it lol my biggest complaint with 60 kbs is the lack of arrow keys and this has those and looks super sleek with those colors love it take care man,1
ugh hate when my summer holidays end at least you brighten my mood with this top tech series thanks,1
awesome variety of products i also like that you had more than five or six items love the budget finds ,1
its so crazy to me ive watched you all the way through middle school till college now over six years and youve grown so much keep working big man reguardless of your age middle school highschool collegeuniversity we gotchu covered,1
 for all the coffee lovers don’t forget to check out cometeer and save 20 on your first order   watch best gifts under 20,1
the kablecard is by far my favorite item on this list when i first saw you have it on the channel i immediately bought it so easy to carry and being able to charge anything with it is great,1
i just wanted to say thank you for making such amazing content we notice all the hard work you do and appreciate it so much,1
as a specialty coffee lover those cometeer pods are amazing if i didnt enjoy the long process it takes to brew a fresh cup of coffee id 100 buy them all the time,1
thanks for consistently providing great videos every time i purchase a new device i come to your channel to find out the best products for it,1
love these accessories you always make great videos,1

love watching your videos just waiting for that best accessories for pixel 6 video,1
love your vids mankeep up the good work,1
be careful with the katchy they are known to start smoking at the top so possible fire hazard its possible that this issue could have been fixed with the newer models but just giving you a heads up great video,1
am i the only one that actually watches these with snacks and drinks  been here since 1 ,1
gotta let your son pick some boxes now he’s old enough to point one out start him in the family business early ,1
i love all the interactions and laughs with everyone in this video personally i think j picked the best tech,1
okay j that 130 was definitely worth it i might get me one a good buy for a traveling tech head,1
still the best series to watch while indulging in a meal cant believe its already the 47th video,1
i absolutely love your wife’s expressions when she’s interacting with you another gundam play games with you giggle… cracks me up,1
thanks for the heads up about grover im a tech reviewer and had never heard of it could be a really nice way for me to get my hands on some items to review very appreciated,1
i love you guys i hope you know that  you guys brighten my day with these massive tech unboxing videos,1
successful people dont become that way overnight what most people see at a glance wealth a great career purposeis the result of hard work and hustle over time i pray that anyone who reads this will be successful in life,1
as someone who used to work 80 hours a week quitting my job to become a freelancer was the best thing i have ever done sure i still work a lot of hours and often close to 7080 hrs a week i feel like i am doing this for myself and not some corporation,1
i have a high paying tech job that i’m about to leave i feel incredibly blessed and privileged to have had it even though i worked hard to get to where i am i was promoted very fast after 5 years i know it’s something many people would love to have and honestly i’m happy that someone else who has worked hard will get my spot ultimately i became burnt out and just need some time to reset my life i have lived humbly saved every thing i could paid off debts as quickly as possible and have enough to live for 8 months to a year i’m hoping to come back into the industry as a healthier employee or have found something else fulfilling for anyone wishing they had one of these jobs or feel frustrated by people that appear to be complaining i hope you achieve your dream and get one you can do it keep at it taking one of these jobs to be financially secure is a blessing i am taking a break because my mental health and stress hospitalized me don’t let that scare you i just have my own personal stuff too ,1
i’m a software developer i understand the struggle but us tech workers should count our lucky stars we are very privileged to be where we are most jobs outside of tech have less perks much lower pay and more stress i am grateful everyday to be in this field once i accumulate enough wealth to purchase my freedom i’ll see myself out maybe in the meantime i will run the race as long as i have to,1
the thing is if you give someone all of these perks and a flexible schedule you need to also give them the freedom to use that flexibility you must make it clear that the company expects you to take down time and you will not be frowned upon either officially or unofficially leadership needs to model that behavior by taking time off and making sure everyone knows theyre taking time off this also empowers your teams letting them know that you trust them to work without constantly staring over their shoulders,1
compare that to physicians only 42 said they were burned out yes indeed a perfectly acceptable percentage,1
that boat pod looks a lot like a saiyan space capsule… i need one lol,1
i would love the glasses and the digital artwork frame,1
cool ,1
nice i love it,1
from all the stuff mentioned i have the dji mic amazing recording device,1
this guy must be the richest youtuber i hear his voice on most tech channel ,1
from all the stuff mentioned i have the dji mic amazing recording device,1
that cable organiser would be incredible in my dorm room,1
enjoyed your video and i gave it a thumbs up,1
vids like these are definitely a service for looking out for everyone to avoid buying crap and hype in dashcams well done in the research thanks ltt,1
i did not expect to love this video as much as i did it epitomizes the very best of youtube in my opinion a wellmade video with a wellconstructed narrative hosted flawlessly and provides a genuinely good service to everyone even if they are not in the market for these products love your work ltt team,1
thank you linus for spending the big bucks and testing all these cameras for our benefit i will be keeping your recommendations in mind when i purchase my camera,1
this is the kind of content that we need calling out trash markets and helping people find honest answers doing the sidebyside comparisons they cant do thanks for this glad to know the rove r24k i got as a gift is not far from really the peak in the market and is good enough if not overpriced a bit,1
yup its amazing though how the market then changes brands for each country in germany we have an entirely different line of knockoff chinese brands which ultimately look alike same goes for the australian american market i am kinda stoked to see though what sort of dashcams are actually used within south korea japan if anybody could give a hint to that i mean surely they must have great dashcams right japan being the leading technology country in the 80s and having a severe amount of car enthusiasts and well south korea being well the main birth place of any technology centre and fab well at least a good portion in my mind i bought this one due to a recommendation from a friend of mine problem i have with it is quality related the gsensor broke not long after i bought the thing and started using it kinda unfortunate this creates an issue of the thing constantly making emergency recordings and in that mode you cant disable the screen from flashing so at night drives youll really get beamed in your faze and think someone put a flashlight up to your head nope its your f dashcam you can improve further the video quality for eg when experincing intense sun glare which is usually caused on these by using a ndfilter you just have to find your own way to mount them usually there is full filter clamping solutions because youll have to overshoot with the filter anyhow i didnt do this yet as i did not find it nessecary to do so but a big german dashcam clip compilation maker did recommend this in one of his dashcam review videos half a year ago or so name of the channel is eure videos fahrnünftig german amazon thieye cv3211 american market jansite nexigo d80 australian nz market volway,1
in all fairness the viofo actually looks pretty great actually worth considering over the thinkware f70 if the budget isnt too tight,1
i love the fact that you put “thinnest rick roll” and “can you legally employ a cat” on the search history even if it flashed on the screen for a second you are one of the only creators that put 100 effort and detail into their content keep it up,1
i’d say the coolest thing in this video is the desk pc saves room and it’s cool to see the desk but i wonder how much it cost and if it’s worth buying,1
im just here to say thank you to him the generosity he has shown will forever be in my heart thanks for the perfect job,1
i own a remarkable 2 and that feeling surreal to hold was the same thing i felt when i got it its great for anyone wanting a device to write with for school and so much thinner and easier to carry around than a notebook or binder especially since you can import and export pdfs for downloading and submitting assignments online,1
man i love how he went from a smartphone focused creator to just all inventions overall this is incredible keep it up arun ,1
thankyou for the effort you put into your videos you spend thousands on each video just for your fans respect ,1
that desk pc is now on my bucket list ,1
i love the fact that you put hilarious search histories at 233 this is the kind of content youtubers need to make keep up the good work ,1
install raid for free  iosandroidpc and get a special starter pack  available only for the next 30 days this is the best iphone accessory in 2022  like these wallpapers download them here  iphone 14 magsafe accessories ,1
in spite of the huge upgrades especially for the pro models it would be interesting to see how many will upgrade to the iphone 14 lineup given that the iphone 13 lineup is as popular as ever,1
honestly can’t wait for the camera testing you do on the pros as a iphone 8 user anything will be an improvement though lol,1
definitely upgrading from my 12 pro max to the 14 pro max ill get at least half the cost of the new phone back with trade in major upgrade in battery camera and the screen,1
in my opinion the 13 mini is the best phone ever made seems i’m in a minority but it’s brilliant,1
eh i’m sticking with my 13 pro max until probably the 15 or 16 the cameras on the 14 pros are literally the biggest worthwhile change this year imo,1
im going to wait for the scheduled iphone 15 pro which will be scheduled to release in october 2023 if everything goes to plan it is expected to have a usb c port and faster charging like the iphone 14 series this is what really matters for me,1
i might upgrade from my 11 pro to the 14 max i guess i don’t care enough to spend the money on the pro max but i want the bigger display and better battery life,1
the information is easily digestible thanks,1
this guy is so professional and has such a calm aura about him exactly what i would like my doctor to have,1
this guy is just wonderful i like that sense of humor in a doctor dr what is wrong with me yes,1
i had a great time with these questions thanks wired ,1
109 ‘no just you’ actually got me i love how they choose professionals with such great fun and easy going personalitiesit makes science a little less nerdy,1
seriously how are these weird topics so engaging probably the professionals they feature but this is a fantastic series,1
as someone with ulcerative colitis im glad to see gastrointestinal issues being put on the spotlight as well as a specialist educating people on this taking care of yourself before it becomes chronic is key,1
had the pleasure of working at the same practice as dr iroku during his time in nc he truly is just as nice in person as he appears in this video so nice to see a familiar face,1
dr iroku has nailed perfect balance of being fun and informative while remaining professional perfect for this series,1
this was one of the best cool tech episodes in a while wow that pocket operator was awesome and i dont even make music,1
i used to have that audio interface 1010 for those who wanna switch from a usb mic to xlr great choice of items this month frank ,1
love those pocket operators never heard of them until this video and now ive done a ton of research on em lol would like to pick one up someday thanks for bringing this dope tech to our attention good sir,1
that led message board is super cool so many options for use love watching your videos and seeing all of the cool affordable tech,1
love the wormier keyboard i have a full size keyboard and the compact option looks amazing and will be a better fit for my small desk,1
i love how theres infinite possibilities that you can do with the pocket operator would love to pick up one of those for exploring it,1
my favorite cool tech gadget in this episode was definitely the audio interface as i am starting to get into the streaming world great episode and for the amazing content,1
gotta say this is one of the best episodes of the series in a while i actually think every single one of these things would be something id go out to buy especially the led sign i finally am picking back up my plan to build my own pc and the flexibility of the sign adds a lot of well flexibility on how i want my endgame to turn out,1
hes a nice fun guy he told my dad at an event my dad was cooking at that he had never seen so many steaks cooked so perfectly so quickly and its one of his favorite memories we have a signed picture with him and my parents in it d,1
idk if this was intentional but i really like how he said “practice makes better” rather than “practice makes perfect”,1
“have a drink or smoke a joint” thanks chef i’ll do both,1
i think its kinda cool that elizabeth haigh sent the tweet about nervous breakdowns the same month she opened her restaurant and now that her question is being answered she has a michellin star,1
i like that he mentioned the omelette thing many years ago i took culinary classes when i considered trying to become a chef and an instructor i had emphasized the importance of a good omelette for restaurant interviews glad to know i wasnt led astray in that,1
i can’t wait to put edible flowers all over my morning cheerios,1
i love how hes wearing a bracelet that says allergic to stupidity,1
fun fact about horsepower its the amount of power a horse can sustain for an entire day so a galloping horse actually has 15 horsepower,1
i love and ride both types of two wheeled transportation  gcntech your talking my language,1
another great video two  thumbs up i know little to nothing about about motorcycle riding nevertheless the gcn team once again has brought another layer to overall world of cycling which for me makes even more interesting wishing the best for scott his team ,1
this was a fascinating look at something i love by some genuinely interested people i will add that you can build a significantly cheaper race bike for a lower key series and still have fun on the track i have a minitwin which is relatively cheap to run but a friend of mine has a litre plus missile and every time he crashes it it costs about £5k and six months at least to fix however i far prefer long adventure rides to whizzing around the track all of which you can do on a minitwin ,1
hanging onto my 8t for now curious to see what oneplus does after the 10 overall coz the 9 10 didnt move me they keep constantly moving from what made them great with each variant  the oneplus 6 being their last great phone,1
i’m waiting for the oneplus 10s or p or q,1
pretty happy with the oneplus 9 camera is killer for sunny days on the beach the oneplus carbon fiber case makes it feel excellent in the hand,1
oneplus have been making some solid looking hardware these days that being said it does feel like they have been sort of trying to become the next samsung with the number of phones that they have been launching,1
you are the only youtuber who compared these two phones for the first time thank you so much ,1
always here for u chris mad respect,1
nice one zoe great job keep us up to date on the latest computer programming news great job ,1
good video as usual ,1
the future of tech is looking more and more amazing,1
the future of tech is soo beautiful,1
good day future tech i noticed your excellent video and am impressed with your amazing sharing on products wed love to collab on a new product experience were working on what would be the best email to contact you,1
could coolper become the average new yorker’s dream hmm make that every ‘coffee lover’ can’t help but notice pixy’s here again a nice hands free it is,1
enjoyed your video and i gave it a thumbs up for the support of your channel,1
209 so im guessing when you make an ad for your product do you really want a guy sleeping right in the middle with an it is what it is pillow lol while everyone else is having fun 237 and that blistering scooter speed of 030 meters per hour i think you meant kilometers per hour all in all pretty cool stuff i like the coolper i can really see that taking off huupe seems to be novelty i can imagine the horror as soon as someone forgets there is a tv there and slams a ball only to shatter the device lol the life straw actually works ive seen several science channels take pond water and view it under a microscope then filter it and view it again it really does work but it does not filter out chemicals in the water just microparticles and microbes,1
im over this channel because 90 of the products they feature in their videos are on kickstarter and honestly at this point they should change the name from kick starter to never starter lol im just saying as im also laughing my butt off because that was hella funny and its also hella true and yes it was also hella shady as well sorry i couldnt help myself anyway back to my point because trust me its a really good point and just in case youre still laughing let me get you back on track so like i said 90 of the products featured on this channel and its sister channel or products that are on kickstarter and about 80 to 90 of the products on kickstarter never even make it to market thats right you read that correct and my numbers are correct because i did my research so basically this channel future tech and its sister channel the future is now both channels are useless because over 90 of the products that they show you you will never ever be able to purchase so basically honestly its a waste of everybodys youtube time unless you like looking at videos that feature products and gadgets that will never come to market and that you will never be able to purchase seriously on being funny and sarcastic but also serious because honestly im so over it and im over this channel thats why i have unsubscribe and im telling everybody else to unsubscribe so have you unsubscribed please everybody unsubscribe because at this point in time future tech and the future is now and all those channels that display products that are on kickstarter and the keyword here is display because basically all the products are prototypes that are on display and the public will never be able to buy them because they will never come to market oh kickstarter oops im sorry i mean never starter oh my god im sorry i couldnt help myself because its still so funny lol  but like i said these products never end up going to market and never end up being sold so this whole useless channel is a waste of my time and your time and everybody elses time okay now guess what times up so goodbye and remember everybody please do yourself a big favor and unsubscribe,1
awesome,1
this lady is awesome her voice makes my throat hurt but i could watch her for hours,1
for all people after covid who want their smell back i did exactly what she described but went a step further and tried to smell back first smells i used to hate or made me want to puke i feel that it trully helped getting my smell back faster the hate in our brain is a true booster it just triggers something xd please let me know if it worked for you too wishing all a speed recovery 3,1
that “section of the tongue” theory is so funny to me because it’s what i was taught as a fact in my high school anatomy class and i was trying to test that out on my own and never could i would always taste every flavor no matter where it was in my mouth i have never heard anyone say it wasn’t true so it’s cool to hear now,1
this woman is unbelievably amazing i want a phd in taste and i want her to be my professor i’m a lawyer and after this one video i’m prepared to quit and pursue taste ,1
what she said about the packaging affecting the taste is so true i always think delivery pizza smells so good and it’s the pizza in the cardboard box that makes it smell amazing just not the same without the box ,1
the amount of people wired gets to interview is amazingall of them has the passion of the kinds of job they r doing idk if job is the right word to use when ua doing something what u love,1
also the amount of carbonation to syrup isnt set in the soda machines and can be changed a soda with more carbonation is a dry soda a restaurant i loved would mix their own rootbeer syrup and you could ask for it to be a dry or sweet whichever was your preference,1
maybe its because i know shes an audiologist but she annunciates everything beautifully and speaks with an even sound level like she clearly works with the hearing impared to naturally say every sound in a word to be heard as easily as possible,1
i’m so glad she talked about how hearing aids are more complicated than just a mic and speaker as someone who has had two of them since i’ve been four i’ve had to explain that so many times also having automatic bluetooth ears is super cool,1
my doctor also told me that our ears are selfcleaning but when i pressured her for some offtherecord advice she finally conceded that if i really really felt the need to clean inside my ear canal i could go ahead and use my elbows i just adore my doctor,1
brilliant wellspoken wellenunciated and a welcoming and animated face great video i learned a lot,1
the way i was hyped to to this i was born with hearing loss so i had to see many audiologist in my life so far people like her made my life so much easier her talking about hearing aids and clearing up misconceptions or even spreading knowledge made me smile ear to ear,1
about earplugs at concerts there are a variety of frequencybalanced earplugs that protect your hearing while preserving the sound quality of the music eargasm and hearos are a couple of examples i highly recommend them,1
loved this as someone who previously studied to be an audiologist in the past also just love all of the expert answers videos on this channel thanks wired and dr emily,1
this was super fascinating although the part about the ear drum being able to self repair was the most surprising to me,1
i suddenly gained immense amount of respect for dyson after watching this,1
you know you’ve made it in life when you can wear glasses like that with absolute conviction,1
james dyson is actually giving really good advice here a lot of these types of qas give really generic advice,1
probably the best interviewanswers so far he leaps off the screen with his eloquent and articulate manner it is very apparent that he is simply a genius,1
this was so entertaining i had no idea the person behind dyson was a true genuine and passionate inventor and to see him speak so nicely about independent designers and the unfair problems they face was amazing,1
james dyson makes legendary household appliances like vacums and hair dryers also james dyson loves his cast aluminum pencil sharper the little things in life,1
your videos make my weekend it is something perfect that i can watch with my 4yearold what we have lunch and it distracts him because his mom is leaving to work your videos honestly are lifesavers thank you,1
858 i got the remarkable as a note takingplanner its has a great design really lightweight and better than carrying a note book or two subscription depending who you are are a hit a miss,1
must admit that new mx master mechanical keyboard looks and sounds great thinking of getting myself one of them now,1
this man really does love gundam respect,1
man the grid studios is my favorite tech that is definitely something to get i got it on my christmas list this year i like the remarkable until i see the price tag thats the remarkable part they can get away with selling it for prices that rival apple products,1
jay had whole lotta energy on this video ,1
as per usual your unboxing videos make me happy actually all of them thanks again,1
thank you for the amazon voucher great content as always,1
hey by popular demand i made a list of all cool tech under 50 products from the last 3 years archived so you can see it all on 1 page,1
my favorite product was definitely the wireless desk charger hope i can finally win one of these love your videos frank keep up the great work,1
on the wireless phone charger i could see installing it under the wood in your nightstands if you have the right kind of furniture for the job also the echo dot stand is super cute definitely made me think of portal turrets too definitely my favorite,1
loved the “invisible” charger would definitely contribute to keeping my clean,1
wow that wireless desk charger is insanely cool i would love one of those,1
this channel is actually really cool instead of being just a kickstarter compilation these are all actual product reviews going to watch a few more before subscribing but so far extremely good channel,1
this might be the best episode of this series ever so many great ideas,1
the charger was my favorite the hidden feature is cool but what i really like is the easy under the desk installation that also saves space,1
what an awesome video i love to see new affordable products come out this makes me wonder why certain tech devices have such an immense shelf price if more technology can be produced at cheaper costs there may be some advancement in the asking price from many everydayused devices such as laptops or desktops,1
i love wireless setups and the wireless charger is always a bonus thanks for the best content as always,1
oh imagine when they get those sound wave extinguishers in giant sizes to catch the forest fires real quick the people animals and homes saved would be amazing not to mention the forests as well what a brilliant invention ,1
imagine we could just buy a sized sheet of film like a screen protector then place it on any window or surface we like such as a mirror bench top or car windscreen and then be able to utilise it like a touch screen  would be more practical than buying an expensive mirror,1
it’s awesome but what happens to the humans that used to do these jobs,1
adore the collection of people you have answering questions they are so intelligent in their respective subject and superbly passionate love learning more,1
this woman was born to be a vet you can just tell shes the 1 of kindergarten girls whos living the dream ,1
if you decide to brush a cats teeth a fencing mask is highly recommended,1
i had a recent fall at work and because i trained myself how to fall off a bike safely i only had minor bruising on my butt i did a tuck and roll like when i fall off the bike great advise alex and ollie,1
when i got right hooked a few years ago i only had time to think “this is gonna suck” and then proceeded to roll a ways on the pavement fortunately i came away with ‘only’ bruises and road rash nothing got broken and i think in part it was because i didn’t have a chance to put my hands out also glad i was wearing a helmet,1
my last crash 3 yrs ago i was on the ground so fast i had no time to react or prepare for the impact but the scar from my collar bone repair looks pretty cool,1
i bought an old tractor to help clear the land i was building on stick with me i was towing a large log when i felt the back of my leg getting wet no problem on the front of my trousers thank goodness turned out that a large sick had punctured one of the rear tires tyres apparently it was fairly common practice to half fill the rear tyres tires with water to improve traction due to the added weight maybe sealant would be a better idea expensive though love the show guys,1
having shot canon for 20 years i switched the nikon in 2016 love both brands but prefered the nikon ergonomics with the dual command dials rather than the canon methodology of the 4 buttons on the top plate r5 really improved that but i love the isoless nature of the nikon sensors canon is getting better in that regard but still behind nikon and sony,1
hey marques i know these sound insignificant but since you rarely update your little donglesaccessories that you carry around and your apps on your home screens i think it would be interesting to get a little maybe quarterly series where you talk about any changes and what youd like to see changedsimplified with those work flows just an idea,1
mkbhd im a photographer and use the peak edc v2 im impressed you got a 16 into the 20l im sure its a snug fit and doesnt leave alot of room for a ipad too wanted to give you a little tip i found on that bag here goes the main compartment has a pass through to the top zip area where phones airpods etc go you just have to fish a cable through the corner i do this by unzipping the side compartment enough to fish through the cable it makes it so i can leave a pass through usb travel battery charger with folding prongs that means i plug in all my devices when theyre in the zip area laptop phone tablet and airpods and they all get charge from the battery and when i get to the hotel late i just plug one one cable into the wall outlet and i hear all my devices chime in unison that they are now charging neatly in place not only that when theyre done charging the battery starts charging i wake up with everything ready to go hope you enjoy trying this out,1
would love to see an edcdaily tech for everyone else in the studio,1
marquess reaction was genuine here he was excited to know as what will come out of his bag next ,1
i went to check out the opal camera because i need a webcam upgrade and it looked pretty legit i loved everything i saw on the site up until the point of the 4month fee to use their software on a 300 webcam i think ill just get a capture card for my mirrorless or pick up a logi webcam instead other than that nice tech kit also yeah your experience with the pixel 6 mirrors my past experience with pixel phones i got one to try something different to the iphone and i loved it for a few months i tried a few customizations but found that leaving it stock was generally the best experience for me then it started unexpectedly slowing down or apps would wig out and crash on me out of nowhere or the camera just wouldnt or it would reboot in the middle of doing something,1
you are carrying great tech and it makes total sense that you are rellying more and more on apple their ecosystem is really good i am an android user and dont stick to just one brand but my wife is allapple and she really likes how seemless everything is cool stuff marques,1
hey marques can you do an updated “the ecosystem explained” i think a lot of viewers would appreciate a video not only for apple side of the ecosystem but also android seeing as though a lot of new products are coming out in support for easy use for androids love all your videos btw ,1
i can see that exoskeleton helping people with limited mobility in the future its a marvelous piece of tech thanks for giving us a glimpse of things to come,1
the exoskeleton probably wouldn’t be affordable for everyone to use and may have long term effects but i think it would be amazing for rehabilitation and other medical related use,1
ive got that azeron keypad highly recommend it for all kinds of applications where quickness is ideal but especially for gaming highly highly you can even find certain models on amazon usually i ordered mine from the factory for the color scheme and one of the newer designs the one on this video is the original design which im sure is still just as phenomenal but my fingers twitch randomly sometimes so having the buttons above the knuckle could have been a problem,1
the game pad that you highlighted actually is already available i am a right arm amputee and also a big gamer and was considering buying it but it’s over 200 us and you would still need a mouse also i have already become very proficient using a standard controller for gaming already and mostly mostly use an xbox controller for my pc so i decided it wasn’t worth it but it’s still a very good design in my opinion and i would love to see how it feels to use irl just not at that price point lol,1
cyborg game controller looks pretty neat i am from from latvia and that company makes pretty high end gaming gear expensive too,1
i will forever appreciate this channel youve helped me and my family a lot your videos advice lessons and funny words are inspirational and helpful to us my husband and i have been able to minimal conscious in spending saving and investing wisely i now earn every week youre such a blessing to this generation we all love you,1
man to think one day i might be able to own a dehumidifier and a battery wow,1
yes the game pad is incredibly convenient but incredibly expensive so seemingly lower quality production than its competitors that being said i would sure love to have one,1
great daily blog you all do a great job picking the most relevant daily headline to cover such a high level discussion in such a short clip i watch or listen every day,1
the market cycle still hasnt met its balance we keep going round in circles while waiting for that huge blow out on a huge support but in the mean time we could always ignore the market ups and downs and stay fully invested big thanks to lily alice for helping me earn over 14 btc by implementing her method and following her guide,1
thank you for this report well done and very helpful,1
its almost impressive how many ltt employees even with a 5k upgrade have the jankiest setups i have ever seen,1
ltt extreme tech upgrades will never not be absolutely funny and somewhat informative,1
i think one of the things i love the most about these intel extreme upgrades is linus learning and getting angry at his employees for everything about their lives,1
this episode has me cracking up hard love the rabbit hole that nick has gone down with the keyboard mods respect,1
i love how even linus doesnt want to fit all those hard drives in in a such a jank way im with you linus ill do a lot to make things easier but thats a bit too far xd,1
i love his space its messy full of things that he could throw away if he really went through it all but its a catalog of and container for life as hes living it rather than just a show piece,1
after seeing the macro pad i was checking out their website and loved all their products ive wanted a product like this for when i stream to make it easier and this here is just what i need its a great product and id love it for my setup,1
very surprised with this months list considering how every single item in the list feels like it could go with my setup or just seems super cool to me usually theres one or two items that i dont think id personally find useful but i am 100 adding all these items to my wishlist,1
i absolutely loved the hoto laser measuring tool as an engineering student i am constantly measuring objects and like using various rulers i would love to own one of these hoto laser measuring tools for sure also this months list particularly caught my eye as everything listed seems like something i would want to purchase in the near future,1
so many great products on this list these are all incredibly practical too especially the macropad the abililty to customize literally every aspect of it is killer,1
the hoto laser was a pretty good change of pace loved it feels very complementary to the theme of office gadgets keep em coming ideas specific underdesk drawers and other more “furniture” alike stuff that will make your setup noice,1
just discovered your channel and the series going to be watching your older ones today while working that macro pad is really cool that would definitely be something id pick up and use,1
that macropad looks killer been looking for a segue into custom keyboards for a while and that seems like a great place to start looks like it would be incredibly useful for both work and personal applications too which is a huge plus would love to have one in the near future,1
i’ve actually been looking for macro pads recently and you just upload the very thing i needed i love that you can customize it to fit your aesthetic truly a must have for any setup,1
that macropad looks so  love the customisation of it all,1
man i seriously love this series and the fact that you buy these failed products steps thing up a notch,1
this is such a good video arun the amount of research locations and editing that this video needed is enormous thank you for doing this ,1
arun looks so fit now im glad to see him taking care of himself too,1
i now know i like this guy i at first thought i had some type of prejudicial dislike of him maybe because he was too smooth and that goes against my grain but i love this guy because he does seem to care about things and many of them seem not to be regarding how much money he can make off of a ad for a person it seems as his reviews are sincere and these seem not to have to do with what ive seen only from him which is technology i really love the fact that this guy cares about peoples safety and he brings up some safety issues which people should be concerned about if they have children especially with the toys and the baby monitors yeah this guy is getting a big a from me,1
im hoping this video will blow you away so much work has gone into it and so many people have been fed because of it  to check out the tiniest tech,1
i really appreciate this shaq episode and the effort that went into making it normal looking things scaled up seems much like mrbeast kinda thing think u got inspired by him i have seen the giant toblerone before in sorted the incredible cooking channel has shown the chocolate bar in their occasion based pretentious product series it cost may be 70 poundsbut what u showed is probably bigger than sorted oneits actually cool and it is my favourite chocolate bar too,1
those earbuds are actually pretty cool decorate it somewhere good and it’d act like good speakers,1
i actually have a mousemat that came with my desk thats larger than the one you have its specifically designed to cover the entire surface of the 55 inch desk since its a desk built for gaming,1
wow i never seen technology that big before,1
i have so much respect for you feeding the homeless with the cake,1
if gaiman decides to start a youtube channel to talk about myths and history i would definitely watch that,1
i know this isnt entirely uncommon with authors but ive always loved how much neil gaiman feels like a neil gaiman character,1
you know it’s gonna be great when he says “unless it’s a furry minotaur” and then specified that this is going to be great,1
its nice to see mr gaiman talk about death as being kind his friend and occasional coauthor terry pratchett wrote about death in the same way,1
i love hearing neil speak and explain things he’s such a character ,1
i have been in love with mr gaiman for decades and i couldnt click on this video fast enough major thanks to wired for this video and major thanks to mr gaiman for doing this for all us fans who cant get enough of him,1
i love how he sings his words ragnarok essennntially beginnnnnnns with everything going wrong,1
you can tell hes serious about his craft but not obnoxious about it the best you can hope for,1
hes really respectful of people enjoying sushi differently class act,1
nothing should look sad it should look bright good to know when the aliens come down looking for human sashimi they wont be coming after me,1
you can tell he smiles all the time he just has a happy atmosphere,1
i love how positive this guy is never says a bad word about anyone made me feel like im not stupid even when hes dispelling my wildly inaccurate preconceptions,1
as long as people understand that this is not traditional chefs have the creative freedom to do whatever they want pitty so many prefer to gatekeep stuff and belittle others who merely do things differently respect to taka sakaeda what a lovely person,1
i am so glad i got to see a sushi chef refer to sushi as finger food i am tired of the snobs looking at me weird every time i decide to just pick up a piece and eat it,1
really appreciate you taking the time and effort of putting it out there look forward to watching more of your great content in the past two years assets like gold 7 nasdaq 19 and sp 29 have all lagged behind the usd monetary inflation rate m2 money supply is up 36 while bitcoin has appreciated 229 during the same period my stock portfolio over the last 2 years is massively down against my bitcoin using thomas fuller strategy in my view bitcoin has been one of the best holds during this uncertain market my bitcoin portfolio have been on a rise although the rates are capricious wiping out some of my profits i still have about 914 btc worth of crypto assets i can take a drop down to 20k and still be doing better than my stock portfolio ive stopped buying most stocks im dcaing into bitcoin and im hoarding cash that will go entirely into bitcoin if theres another good drop,1
the record ill love to break is becoming the first millionaire in my family history ive read about people coming from the dirt to making over 2millions in few years and id love to know how to build wealth and amass good profit against all odds,1
can definitely vouch for the switch grip i used to never play handheld mode because of how uncomfortable it was now i do it all the time with the grip,1
dude that battery swap alone would sell me over the sony h9 steelseries hit it hard with that feature i wish more peripherals had that ability,1
its a great month for tech with a lot of cool and reliable products love em all,1
i gotta admit that steelseries headset is next level also the switch grip being under 20 is a steal,1
the oivo grip is amazing have one for my v2 switch as well,1
the music in the background is just a classic for this channel love it,1
best part about the novas is being able to use the switch with it since it has bt i go from pc play some ps5 then go off the grid with the switch all on one headset it’s amazing,1
when we moved to home working i got the logitech mx master 3 it’s been great as an all round mouse i miss my setup when i have to go back i to the office lol although i could just take my mouse with me,1
i love this series the experts are not judgemental and very professional,1
such innocence when he reads “godstiddies” he is adorable,1
i would absolutely love to attend a paleontology course that guy was running his enthusiasm is infectious,1
since when were pterodactyls not dinosaurs since ever that is probably one of the greatest answers,1
hearing this guy stay professional while reading the username godstiddies was the highlight of my day,1
that was cool i like that he said jurassic park was for entertainment not science i often hear people complaining that things like jurassic park arent scientifically accurate who cares i watch that kind of stuff to be entertained if i want to learn something ill watch a documentary which i also do,1
the fact that birds are technically dinosaurs is a fact that would have blown my mind as a kid which is why i try to bring it up with kids as often as i can growing up plesiosaurus was my favorite “dinosaur” although it’s technically not a dinosaur my other favorites are maiasaura and parasaurolophus,1
you can always tell when someone enjoys their job he is so enthusiastic and knowledgeable about dinosaurs what a great series,1
nyof course dems did well,1
putin is the greatest gift to nato since the end of the cold war now thats funny,1
happy independence day ukrainian people,1

thank you very much for your analytical comments and predictions on the war in the ucraine as such more vital weapons supply nato expanding with finland and sweden to face putins war agression and threats and moral worldwide support growing for a democratic and free ucraine as it can daily be seen,1

thank god for the people who called it in and the officers who responded,1
great job to everyone that was aware and made a call to action you helped save lives unfortunately this is becoming the normal but if we are alert and step in we can avoid a tragedy,1
shows what a tremendous difference we can make by being alert and notifying the authorities when suspicious better to be safe than sorry the police aren’t able to do this on their own without us all being aware and responsible citizens massive thank you to all those involved especially those who did chose to speak up ,1
i’m grateful that someone was paying attention and called it in and everyone is safe i’m sad for the young lady though who feels like it was the only place she could go to feel accepted i hope she can find some peace and friendship in a more permanent way,1
excellent job to the grant county sheriffs office and to the people attending the concert who kept an eye out and reported it,1

prayers that everyone in their family get to dry ground and stay safe but also this is a blessing so many of these areas really needed this water,1
hope the person missing in zion national park is found safehopefully they were able to get to higher ground,1
the rain is greatly needed in some areas but i want folks to be safe also ,1
the potential tropical storm passed thru here in merida yucatan a couple days ago was pretty fierce our strongest storm of the 2022 rainy season definitely needed to place objects that can become airborne in a safe place hopefully monterrey will get the much needed rains theyve been praying for,1
,1
that boy and girl just at the end of the report theyre so happy in spite of the invasion of their country those two are great ,1
we need more britt coverage ,1
if you can’t sleep at night just listen to joe biden you will go to bed within minutes no need to buy an app ,1
when i first got into watching netflix there were a lot of low budget but very original and interesting documentaries and tv series on it however in recent times i feel like a lot of the diversity in the platform has gone,1
honestly maybe it would have made more sense to commission more games based on their original ips yeah it takes longer to come out but you’ll get better quality and hopefully better return on investment,1
i think this is gonna take netflix back to its feets it just needs more perseverance and the ability to be positive minded,1
linus just turn the key lights 180 and bounce them off the walls you’ll get a much softer glow and shadow and way more even lighting it’s such a simple fix i’m not sure where along the lines people got the idea to beam the lights directly at your face ,1
dan continues to be my new favorite he has such an air of confidence about him and a comforting presence like dan shows up and you just know things are going to be fine,1
dan managing to set up his soldering station on the one box they needed was incredibly amusing to me,1
linus gets on his employees cases for all the stuff stolen from the office also linus proudly talks about all the stuff stolen from work hes using in his upgraded setup linus why are you using this monitor as a table also linus uses the monitor as a chair this video was hilarious,1
dan the man saving the day riley needs to give him his own theme like brian the electrician,1
dan continues to be a favourite for me hes like the incredibly patient but longsuffering dad who just gets on with things,1
dan is a treasure your channel has long lacked a mr fixit type and while i am sad its not me dan appears quite capable and funny,1
blows my mind how quickly dan became the rock upon which all things linus standslove it,1
hey linus a good trick for streaming lights bounce them off the wall much easier on the eyes and a nice softer look also for indoors id recommend a hypercardioid mic looks like a short shotgun like the audiotechnica at4053b,1

as someone living in the future i can confirm that this is perfectly accurate,1
i remember doing this back in 2000 good times talking about his mother,1
this honestly sounded like a legitimate prediction until the last part xd,1
wow the concept of sending games over the internet lines sounds so compelling i wish online multiplayer was real ,1
man i love seeing old media predict the future correctly they even showed the lack of joy all gamers have,1
wow im so excited for the future alongside flying cars 2000 is looking to be rad,1
ilets all appreciate the amount of effort this man puts in his videos amazing keep grinding bro i love the videos,1
let’s take the moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into his for us great job mate,1
the skins just got released and hes the first one who ive seen that have it love this content him and other fortnite youtubers make,1

as a destiny veteran and current destiny 2 tourneys player i think they did pretty good with zavala and the others ikora and exo stranger,1
massive thank you to everyone for checking out the video i went back and forward on making it whether it was too negative or not but very reassuring to know its not just me noticing these things and wanting to talk about them cheers scott,1
i adopted a mindset of delaying my gaming brain by a year if a game comes out in 2022 i wait until 2023 i get it at its cheapest and usually complete i have been doing this with every game i buy for the last 5 years and i have saved so much money while enjoying the games much more,1
good video these are the kinds of topics and discussions the gaming industry needs to need to be having now publishers developers the media and gamers themselves have to throw one in though for every game with a yearly release i also have to point out games with decade or more release cycle how long between gta 5 and 6 fallout 4 and 5 skyrim and elder scrolls 6,1
when i think about the games i played the last few years i must say that i almost always enjoyed indie titles alot more than big ips so i rather pay 30€ for an indie title that is really inspiring with fresh new ideas than wasting 60€ on a broken aaa title without any innovations,1
i tend to stick to games made before 2010 as they give the best value and experience feels like games were made for fun rather then rip off the player,1
one of the best thing about dude is that he never takes credit for himself when he achieved something he always regular us the audience his team and he is polite in all his video we congratulatiet ourselves on this achievement more to come,1

very relaxing video it helped me sleep,1
ive been around for every console generation i remember thinking during the genesisturbografx era snes not out quite yet what games would be like when i was old and the kind of specs they would need obviously i had no idea what the specs really meant back then but i was thinking 256bit lol as for the cpu and 64bit is all we really need for that they have happily progressed faster than i had imagined looking just as good today if not better then i imagined things would look like 2025 years from now the 1990s and early 2000s with the massive clock speed increases and the advent of the gpu were the main things that took us to where we are hardware wise,1
we are an architecture and construction company in chile and we have used unreal engine for a long time and it is the best for realtime visualization  the preview versions of unreal 5 were already spectacular and the best thing is the lighting lumion really changed everything its great that this is being talked about not only in games but also in movies and other experiences like ours there are plenty of tutorials to learn  we did it that way out of fear to learn it,1
i actually home every game system dating back to my atari 2600 i never ever thought games would look this good i cant imagine how they will look 20 years from now with how fast technology keeps moving forward,1
im over the moon hyped for the day before i hope it delivers in the hype like elden ring did if thats even possible for developers other than fromsoft,1
most games these days look mind blowing especially when you can remember when gaming pretty much first started with games like pong etc,1
these games look insane cant wait to play some of them great list by the way,1
im so glad i built a nice high end rtx 3090 pc a year ago its incredible the amount of eye candy 4k gaming treats us with no wonder its the biggest money making entertainment industry on the planet thanks for those awesome little previews nicely presented too much appreciated,1

wow im impressed think theyve set a new bar with that spec and it being a 42,1
this monitor looks really clean with almost no bezels i like how it’s got a tilt adjustable stand as well nice video,1
my favorite part of this tv 42 is basically tv size is the custom heatsink i dont care too much about the size of the back of the monitor as long as it doesnt dim the brightness constantly,1
great video i think ill still be leaning toward the c2 though as the £400 price difference at the moment is too appealing,1
awesome review what are your thoughts on the picture quality compared to the lg c2 42 does the matte coating make a noticeable difference to the picture quality i want to get a new monitor for work and gaming but not sure if i should get the c2 at a cheaper price this or perhaps wait another year for something new,1
oled gaming wow please compare to the c2 you had as a monitor side by side to see that contrast difference uniform brightness difference etc for those comparing the c2 42 and this love your content,1
thanks for the review i cant wait for your full review my dream spec for a gaming monitor would be pretty close to this 42 inches or so antiglare normal aspect ratio not ultra wide but 1440 200mhz instead of 4k because not even a 3090ti will do anywhere near 4k 138mhz in most decent looking aaa titles anyway if possible i had a couple of suggestions for things to look at over the course of your full review what do resolutions other than 4k look like on the monitor try playing a game in 10801440 and seeing what the monitors scaling is like in the settings what hdr options are available thanks,1
hi spawnpoiint im looking forward to the complete review youre the most thorough and thoughtful reviewer ive seen one thing id like to see in the review is a comparison with a matte screen ideally a sidebyside in different conditions to illustrate the pros and cons and help us decide what coating we prefer dont know if thats feasible for you in any case thanks for the work and enjoy,1
1st meme my dad had gotten me resident evil 4 i had fallen in love with it but my dad saw my explode a granados head and got really surprised at the amount of violence in this 18 rated game,1

gotta love lenovo got the ryzen 5600h version of this laptop with the same 3050 after seeing the positive reviews you guys gave it and i couldnt have been happier it was 700€ in italy at the time paired with my wacom cintiq and a ram upgrade its been the perfect little gaming and digital painting set up,1
people have been going crazy for the gigabyte g5 kd going for a relativelyaffordable price for an i5 11400h and rtx 3060 would be cool to see you guys buy and review it to see how good it is,1
lenovo always been crazy in the budget gaming laptop market my first introduction to pc gaming was a 1080p lenovo with sli 750ms was a killer deal too back when the 7 series was nvidias newest line i remember looking up so many videos about its performance in games weeks before i got it i havent gotten anything lenovo since as i build my own towers now and get much more premium laptops but i will always appreciate and respect what lenovo does,1
nice definitely a great value i still have my old lenovo 960m 4gb gaming laptop i never upgraded it from 8gb of ram and that wouldve been an easy move for more performance now it doesnt make sense as i upgraded to an alienware with a 3080 and 32gb of ram but i still sometimes fire up the lenovo to see what it can do in 2022,1
i just bought this today on best buy for 570 dollars love to see your making a video on it,1
recently bought a lenovo legion laptop for 539 on ebay 4600h 1650 ti 8gb rams and 512ssd never been happier lenovo makes the best bang for the buck laptops also they aren’t to flashy,1
i got an older version of the ideapad gaming 3 with a 1650 but with a ryzen 5600h and a 512gb ssd its an amazing laptop but i bough it at the time last year for 750 not a bargain but a well balanced laptop for work and gaming,1
i have the model from 2019 mine has an i79850h and a mobile gtx 1650 this is a great machine aside from some plastic chipping due to the lid being opened and closed it annoyingly was 1300 with discounts,1
oh boy cant wait to buy it in 2 years when theyre in stock,1
never thought id say this but i got my ps5 today its absolutely breathtaking,1
truly excellent overview concise and informative i genuinely feel better equipped to make my decision regarding the playstation 5 after watching your review appreciate you and your consistently fine work,1
just stumbled upon your channel after successfully ordering a ps5 yesterday through sony direct the anticipation of it getting delivered made me want to watch some unboxings and reviews i came across your channel and immediately clicked because we have the same last name which is neat haha i actually really enjoyed your video it’s informative offers great insight and very professional while maintaining a personal creative nuance thank you,1
i got the controller alone for use on my pc and im shocked that it works so natively well of course none game that i know of uses the trigger gimmick but the soundvibration feedback works like a charm sure it does require some set up but it works,1
i honestly think marques should start a gaming channel only so we can appreciate him enjoying his tech in the way most people will do being very analytical and knowledgeable about tech is a great benefit to those who come to this channel but there is a slight otherworldliness to seeing some talk about tech in a matter of fact way and not seeing them actually use it in a real world environment and showing that they actually enjoy the thing they are criticisingwhich to be fair no one with sense would think he doesnt enjoy his tech but seeing it would be a great addition,1
the controller really is the coolest thing about the ps5 astro’s playroom is insane with the haptics,1
can we take a moment appreciate the level of effort norman put into this video the research facts analysis and narration are top notch i love the visual aspects like magazines figures gone box art and trinkets great job norm,1
being an 80’s baby 90’s kid it just feels like a blessing to have experienced all this first hand,1
this is hands down the best nintendo documentary i have seen in my entire life huge video game fan im 44 now and getting those memories back is awesome along with tones of things i didnt know cheers,1
your documentaries are soooo well written and edited thanks for the great content man,1
i’m in my earlier 40s i’ve found it difficult to go back and still enjoy many of the games from my youth but super mario world still holds up i think it will continue to stand the test of time with the ageless gameplay and level design it’s a masterpiece,1
a fantastic and well made documentary that truly made me feel like a kid again i could feel my 5 year old self anticipating this 16 bit treasure as you were describing the build up to mario worlds launch in america i havent truly felt that way in a long time thank you i think i am going to go play some mario world now,1
first allnighter i had was with a friend playing super mario world will never forget it seeing the artwork in the instructions book that came along brings back so many memories remember how awesome it was when you first discovered the sta rroad the top secret area in the donut ghost house the music in vanilla dome or valley of bowser damn it i wanna play now,1
ive been following you since the start always top quality and youve outdone yourself amazing video thank you,1

345 seein bill get all excited like that describing the play… just let’s you know how exciting and high iq ed reed was in his time him and troy are the best safeties i’ve seen in my lifetime by far,1
im not into sports at all but damn i am so amazed at how these guys can act like one mind with a single thought just incredible cooperation,1
polamalu jumping over the line against the titans is extra smart because he knows that even if hes too early its a flag but just half the distance to the goal theyre already so close to the goal line that it doesnt matter,1
in case you’re wondering why the clock didn’t stop at that obj play the rule states that if you aren’t gaining yards while going out of bounds the clock keeps running this is a great example of obj he can’t just catch but he can run throw kick you name it,1
wow what an incredibly well researched video so many great moments and some i havent even seen before only wish you wouldve included when alex smith hid the ball from the refs but great video nonetheless,1
the fact chris paul knew that rule is impressive,1
what a game of football the passion the fights refereeing decisions all of it this is why we love the premier league,1
passion aggression goals assists push n pulls yellow and red cards celebrations and fights this is something us man utd fan wish to see in our team but can only see in other teams epl at its best moments kudos to the two epl contenders great match,1
the volley was great but cucurella’s cross was also a thing of beauty,1
most exciting game of football i’ve seen in a long time it had everything,1
what a goal by koulibaly what a crazy game what a handshake ,1
imagine youre a manchester fan and you here watching this brilliant game,1
i’m a chelsea fan chelsea vs tottenham are always some of my very favorite match days of the season they never ever fail to excite,1
if this is only the 2nd week of the premiere league i cant wait for what the rest of the season brings the beautiful game the passionate game,1
im 46 years old this music rocks my world,1
i literally ran from my house to the forest near the park that’s near my house and started playing this cause today i felt magical ,1
ive been out of high school for 7 years in may its not very often that i hear a newer song and get sent back to the musical equivalent of me in 2013 ive been trying to do some trauma healing using this song and i think ive made some progress slowly but surely i am starting to love myself again after years of just trying to survive wilist hating myself i may not be happy now but im on the road to being there i dont care if nobody sees this i just know im getting better and thats all that matters,1
why do i start crying every time this plays no reason i just do i love this song,1
this music is amazing god my heart stumbled upon them whilst searching guitar videos for lessons now im playing along,1
all her music is just so good like i can relate to most of it and the sounds in her music are so sad yet upbeat and happy ive never heard music like hers in my life and i really like it,1
this song is my go to whenever i feel something this song usually helps me go back to feeling empty thanks,1
i heard this song in a store once and it became one of my favorites i finally found it again love your music beach bunny 3,1
great sound and vibe reminds me of mid80s college radio,1
why am i crying  tee tee was running for her dear life because jamaica was on her tail like lightning amazing race athletes performing at the highest level ,1
so proud of these ladies  they beat a jamaican team with 3 of the best sprinters we’ve ever seen absolutely incredible,1
jenna prandini’s leg was crazy she passed one of the greatest ever sprinters and put the usa in the lead wow,1
tee tee teri is such a sweetheart that face brings me to tears every time jamaica was trying to run her down little baby face teetee go girl go,1
beating thompsonherah fraserpryce and jackson in a single race is massive for any team on any stage,1
wow usa 3 of them are rookies amazing beating the jamaican legends prandini is awesome on the curves all 4 did what they had to do to win,1
when i saw melissa jefferson’s reaction during the announcements i immediately knew usa was going to win she looked dialed in,1
shoutout to my american queens yall deserve everything and more,1
this was such an exciting race the jamaicans are so competitive i love it the germans emotions after making the podium was contagious,1
team jesus  comment down below if your on his winning team ,1
hurdleskicks a man is one of the best calls of all time,1
that marion barber back flip though   rip legend ,1
the funniest part about the baez thing is as soon as javy turned around the first baseman could have turned around and stepped on first and ended the inning,1
124 is a smart move shot clock doesnt move until he touches the ball but the game clock does roll,1
 dp tour tickets available now ,1
all you guys bring me happiness and joy to my days when i watch you,1
i know this video has been out a long time but i can’t get enough of dude perfect,1
just saying that ever since cory shaved them eyebrows he has been straight fire in battles,1
3 years later still not done another annual baseball battle but still love the content keep it up ,1
greatest come back ever  although cory deserved to win ,1
coby always deserves a second chance,1
this quickly turned into very possible moments,1
some people are not only incredibly talented they work hard on their skills and perform what seems impossible stephan curry and tiger woods come to mind right away both work incredibly hard in practice and alone as well,1
054 best teammate in the history of the world he jumped off the bench and was cheering way before the ball went in,1
550 that man knows what he just did was impressive as hell he deserves to feel proud for that,1
110 love the inevitable evan longoria clip but right after that is the volleyball player going into the stands to keep the ball alive i’m surprised that they allowed that ,1
i loved that you added volleyball in this compilation more less popular sports need recognition like cricket dodgeball and badminton,1
incredible performances i just loved all the scenes shown just marvelous,1
i swear every half court shot when the time ends is epic,1
an amazing performance definitely maguires best performance in a united shirt,1
maguire needs a standing ovation for staying out of this one my god a real captains performance for sure,1
i’m not a united fan but when i say this game gave me chills it reassured me why i watch the premier league,1
crazy seeing ronaldo on the bench it’s really the beginning of a new era,1
this defense was really solid i can’t wait to see the addition of casemiro with this coaching and this rebuilt defense we’ll do really good this season,1
the fans were there for the players tonight and they didn’t disappoint,1
this game was very emotional for me the way we have played in recent seasons has been frustrating still early but this could be the start of something great,1
i like to see man utd fans happy they’ve been thru a lot they deserve it,1
this is why we love epl even the games between bottom teams are so exciting,1
liked this video make sure to check out the top 100 sports bloopers of the decade,1
i like the clips where someone makes one of the better plays ive seen and the announcer is like that is definitely one of the best plays this weekend ,1
love the variety but the minneapolis miracle in the 90’s while we got regular season mlb in the top 20… cmon man,1
i forget how much i appreciate the other sports i’m a hockey person but wow baseball the nfl wow even soccer when they’re not crying on the field wow what great athletes,1
felicidades es un buen ejemplo 250 sentadillas son unos topgirlsuno muchas y un buen ejercicio 525 se deja ver que hay muy buenos resultados  saludos desde la cd de world  los mortales abian apreciado tan hermosa mujer,1
i played on the field for number 31 i was in the australian juniour league world series team and had alot of memories come back to me from looking at the scenery,1
910 the game was almost over and was a blowout at that point dallas 52 buffalo 17 yet check out don beebe still giving 100 effort after the game bills owner ralph wilson walked from the owners booth to the locker room and thanked beebe for the play,1
being a packers fan i remember watching that game against the seattle seahawks where hassleback said they were going to score in ot and when al harris picked him off and took it back i remember my family and i was jumping up and down yelling and going nuts one of my favorite sports moments ever especially with my favorite team being the ones offering the karma back at hassleback,1
success is the best revenge my dad used to say and its true,1
pujols and trout taunting with the bow and arrow gestures was priceless,1
this is unreal congrats on doing this at such a special place,1
dude they actually got jim nantz to announce it legendary,1
i was watching this with my dad and he didnt believe they were actually at the masters its crazy great job to the editors the team and bryson big achievement to be able to play at one of the most prestigious places on earth,1
it’s always a blessing whenever they decide to play everybody’s favorite battle another round of all sports golf,1
this is the greatest video ever made  well done dude perfect bryson the full team,1
as much as i love seeing these battles i think the guys should change the frisbees to the disc golfing frisbees they travel farther than the regular ones,1
awesome video thanks to the masters management for allowing this great way to keep those youngsters involved very generous from the masters as always all class,1
i attended the masters on thursday and the woods on 15 was a great place to stand for a while so many golfers ended up there and got to see them up close what a fantastic experience,1
this arsenal side is proving itself very nicely playing with a lot more fluidity what a signing gabriel has been for them,1
arsenals attack is so fluid and theyre playing so well man theyre fr looking real dangerous this season,1
all game the fans were loud and behind the team especially the saliba chant this team is different and they’re together coyg,1
it’s such a shame that the gabriel jesus goal was ruled offside he’s playing out of his skin at the moment and deserved that goal zinchenko played amazing today marteneli and jesus are always a threat and xhaka has been playing well consistently under his new role and ofc we gotta talk about saliba so young yet he plays like a veteran special mention to ben white who’s also been playing good at right back,1
3 wins won’t guarantee us a top 4 finish but it’s better than 3 defeats which is where we were last season,1
its great to see arsenal win the games they are supposed to win excited to see them against top 4 competition,1
watching gabriel jesus in this team right now honestly puts such a huge smile on my face him and odegaard just fit so well together and the interplay between them and the wings is just so fun to watch finally happy watching arsenal play again,1
compared to the same time last year i feel like im living in the cloud 9 3 games 3 wins 9 points 9 goals scored with only 2 goals allowed can you believe that for ones like tierney tomiyasu and smith rowe who were main starters for arsenal last season we will definitely need their contribution more as the season goes by i hope they can be patient grab the opportunities and show what they are capable of on the pitch as the season keep going on compared to the last season this is a huge improvement the squad depth is so much thicker that we are using tomiyasu smith rowe and tierney as substitutes hopefully next week i would like to see vieira to make a debut even if its just for 10 or 20 minutes,1
arsenals got 3 gabriels and all of them have been phenomenal,1
tears in my eyes i prayed for these times of having a solid team,1
2 32 what is even more amazing is that he used the support of his opponent’s shoulder to facilitate his own rotation in midair i didn’t see it the first time either,1
113 that was the best golf shot ive ever seen,1
i want more of these videos in my life so enjoyable to watch sport at its very best,1
only a 5 hours after the game was over this time that’s record speed good job guys,1
that diaz goal was reminiscent of his wonder goal vs peru in the copa amer in fact he scored like that a bunch of times for porto too class player,1
credit to crystal palace that was a great counterattack before the goal reminiscing of brentfords 4th on saturday,1
that luis diaz goal is an instant classic as a colombian i could not be happier ,1
both goals scored were absolutely amazing what a result for palace wish nbc could’ve uploaded this earlier though ,1
milner was all over the pitch this game this man still has it,1
i love luis diaz so much what a player what a character,1
as a neutral fan i’m really happy to see both zaha and diaz scoring both top tier players in the league,1
luis diaz has a big heart sharp teeth and an amazing attitude for liverpool sweetest of goals,1
luis diaz always showing great character and ready to sacrifice anything for this team ,1
the way you sync the whole video is just smoooooth ,1
that wind assist goal was amazing,1
great video great voice stay safe man keep it up,1
126 king  amazing video bro thank you,1
that love shared between canelo and plant man is something else “you have a beautiful family you are my family” i love this sport ,1
plant and canelos postfight talk is honestly one of the best moments ive ever seen great stuff before the bell in the ring and after the fight,1
the fact that jake and logan are featured is hilarious to me,1
its really great to see canelo fight over the years and progress as a fighter enjoy him while you can fellas boxing is in great hands,1
wow highlighting the conversation during the fight and after the fight was awesome classy for both fighters great job showtime,1
that exchange canelo and plant had was deep and with all due respect ,1
i like jermell charlo ive met him more than a couple of times and hes a cool guy but castano won that fight imo,1
año de canelo ,1
wow what saul said after the fight made me tear up a little you are my family now respect,1
part 2 coming soon youtube decided to cut my upload in half for some reason  so the rest of the video will be uploaded later this week ,1
i love how in the first one he immediately turns to the penalty box like “i know the drill guys”,1
115 made me laugh way harder than it should have,1
i love how at 2 minutes the thunder happens and the pitcher just drops everything and turns around like nope im gonna dip yall have fun,1
im amazed at how players are able to react in the moment in ways that seem superhuman and then sometimes they dont even react as if it was special,1
worth watching worth sharing excellent content delivered as advertised thank you,1
very entertaining one thing amazing about sports are the things that happen that are unexpected i remember my wife was given a free ticket to a diamondbacks game which went zerozero so she finally left and when she came home she said i got bored with the game the diamondbacks went on to score seven runs in the last inning after she left winning the game i teased her endlessly after that suggesting she should not attend more dbacks games and they went on to win the world series that year my wife not in attendance but glued to their last game with the yankees and luis gonzalez base hit that won the game i met joe montana and that football season he went on to win his last superbowl and i saw the ending in french in montreal in 90 during my flight from sfo to toronto and the connecting flight to montreal our air canada pilot gave us updates on a onesided blowout i also will never forget the stanfordcal game in 82 and the play when cal beat stanford and the band became part of the game some still argue over two of the lateral passes but the win for cal was as it was and i still say that is among the craziest moments in sports history my own crazy moment was when i was called in to play center for our grammar school flag football team even though i was the smallest player on ours and the opposing team the school we played had no players above the sixth grade so i agreed we won the game though i had only played center in school practice and never in a competitive game adrenalin had me psyched and our qb said i threw perfect spirals i would intimidate the bigger players since they feared id plow under them and stop them from getting to the qb and they never did he was not sacked our team went on to win the norcal championship undefeated in our twelve team league my brother playing as wide receiver though i no longer had to play since the school had seventh and eighth graders i never went on to play in high school feeling i was too small to be as good as i was in my grammar school game where i also played on the defense and i stuck to distance cycling and golf both of which i enjoyed and also had many crazy moments and i was decent at the 440 as it was then now the 400 meters even in my early 60s now and despite a leg i broke badly in a freak accident a couple of years ago i still enjoy cycling as well as hiking and also laser tag and go kart racing on my channel here cactus521 i even have a video of me jumping off the vegas stratosphere tower when i was 52 though the wind was so fierce my eyes watered i felt peace and not fear on the way down choosing that vs skydiving as my free fall bucket list item since there is no reason to jump out of a perfectly good airplane ,1
you know it’s a good game when there’s 20 minute highlights,1
saint max on his day can break down any press man incredible so fun to watch definitely one of those “streets will never forget” kind of players,1
it’s not even about the draw against the champions for me it’s the way howe has newcastle playing free attractive positive going forward football and no fear of great opposition wow genuinely love to see it,1
this game was insane as much as a win would be satisfying i would take a draw all day over a loss respect to newcastle what an amazing game edit1k likes………idk how to feel about this lmao,1
couldve never predicted how amazing of a midfielder joelinton has become,1
my god kdb is insane his vision and passing skills are absolutely generational havent seen anything like it since xavi and sneijder,1
well done magpies saintmaximin attacking with pace at man city defense is a blue print for rest of epl,1
emotional day havent seen a newcastle side play that well against man city no less in a very long time gutted but grateful to get a point in the end just a heroic team performance could single every player in the starting xi out for praise just so proud of all of them as for city ill just say i clapped as soon as i saw de bruyne had played silva in on goal just phenomenal football i mean at times during that match it was terrifying when city had possession a wonderful side and a wonderful manager,1
throwin’ it back to our old school trick shot days        thanks for watching guys we seriously appreciate you a ton,1
i see you cody with those frisbee skills im impressed,1
how has this not become a series yet great job dudes,1
man these all these trick shots are so dope wish i daily’s be like you guys in the future,1
thanks coby for giving some love to badminton i really love the sport and it feels great that you can shine a spotlight on it once in a while,1
can we just appreciate that they got a baseball field football field hockey rink and a soccer field just for one video edit thank you for all the likes i’ve never gotten this many,1
shout out to all my badminton players out there i know your sport doesnt get alot of love thats hits me right in the feels man thank you,1
i loved the garret in this video he had sooooooo much energy,1
i know i’m not the only one going back during quarantine and rewatching all the dude perfect vids in fact they inspired me and i do my own trickshots on this channel,1
i always love seeing the coaches reaction just celebrating someone elses success together feels good even to watch,1
just saw duplantis won the olympics hes definitely a legend making all those jumps to the gold medal not a single fail,1
fastest red card the only world record i could achieve,1
the world record that i remember with pleasure is the first in a total of 11 of federica pellegrini in 2008 she was unjustly disqualified in the semifinal of her favorite race the 200sl so the next day she made the 400sl record in her career she also made a couple of records the same day but the first was particular,1
one of the best races i have ever seen,1
the longest shot has won the kentucky derby gives me chills and make me smile what a quote and a race,1
well probably never see something like this again legitimately one of the coolest things ive ever seen in my life,1
in all honesty this might be the greatest kentucky derby victory of all time the longest shot passes the favorite right at the end you can’t write a story better than that,1
i can’t get enough of this race the way he says “rich strike” in the end is legendary…,1
that friggin horse looked like a running back cutting back and across midstride breaking for daylight then breaking it open to the end zone awesome display of athleticism horse and jockey,1
it’s such a treat seeing spectacles like this good for rich strike…even if this horse does not win anymore rich strike is in the history books,1
rewatching this and watching rich strike the whole way knowing what’s about to happen and hearing the announcers reaction i got chills up and down my spine what an unbelievable race,1
enjoy the thumbnail hahahahahaha,1
give that guy on the tennis court an a for attitude good sense of humor,1
love the videos gonth ,1
yo gonth love your channel and i love you vids they have been helping me through lockdown keep it up man ,1
the man hitting grealish is my favourite clip man what a legend,1
team jesus  comment down below if your on his winning team ,1
i don’t know why but the cop cheering for papi’s home run always makes me laugh,1
i love how the cleanup crew beats the medical crew to do their job,1
2157 that guy was my best friend as a young kid we went to school together great guy i will forever cherish this clip as teasing material,1
that golden state warrior doing the splits always makes me laugh ,1
this is the type of video that i like showing one clip after another without five minutes of talk and leadup to each one yes we can figure them out all by ourselves good job,1
41 that cheerleader got her head in the game all puns intended  thank you for this video theyre all great,1
aaronson becoming a star is awesome to see as well as marsch’s slap handshake at the end,1
hopefully we stop hearing about how much trouble leeds are in without raphinhaphillipsbamford i love all 3 but we have replaced them well,1
it’s crazy how nobody has mention how big rodrigo been these past games he is an amazing player before the prem and he is finally showing his potential that he had since his valancia days,1
i’ve been a huge aaronson fan for a while now dude is an absolute lightning bolt and refuses to quit every time he plays for usmnt he provides a spark glad to see him doing well,1
very impressed with leeds united so far love how aaronson has no quit in him and has a lot of heart glad to see american players doing well in the premier league with aaronson and adams hope they keep this up throughout the season,1
what a freaking start for jesse marsch and the squad lets gooooo,1
might not have world class quality but they have world class commitment pressing and energy very fun and promising performance,1
aaronson is a must start at the world cup,1
finally maguire used in a brilliant way what a game for harry ,1
god bless ten hag finally mu has a manager with balls i pray he gets time to implement his vision and philosophy,1
martinez is all of 64 in his 59 height a giant among giants,1
i’m not over excited because man u usually turn up against the big teams we are good at counter attacking but against teams that sit back is when we struggle,1
love that rashford didn’t make that first question about himself knowing he hadn’t any goal contributions in the prem in months he put the club first class ,1
not that impressed with how spurs are controlling a game but thoroughly impressed by their resolve and determination every game so far this season they’ve faced stiff competition and they keep rising to the challenge it’s awesome to see no matter where they go,1
really good response in the second half have to start games better if we want to win against the better teams though,1
wolves are so close to being a top flight team however glad to see spurs come out on top,1
as a sad wolves fan im actually encouraged by how well they played after this start though im already scared,1
fun fact17 more goals to go and harry kane will become tottenhams all time record goal scorer jimmy greaves 1st with 266 goals kane 2nd with 250 goals,1
the play at 1206 suprised me hopefully jimenez regains his confidence and plays like this more,1
i like coby’s attitude even though he fails a lot he’s always on the positive side keep on going coby,1
ty is phaenomenal every time i think no way he is finishing the last one but he really thrives under the pressure his mentality is outstanding but regardless of the outcome each and every video is a massive team effort ,1
whats most impressive is how the editors managed to extend a 3 minute song into 11 mins without sounding boring,1
ive literally watched this dozens of times over the last 4 years its one of the best,1
videos never disappoint,1
whenever i see this video in my recommended i always have the urge to watch it every single time theres no stopping it anybody else have that,1
511 combining the joke with cody’s laugh makes this amazing lol,1
congratulations dude perfect for reaching 100000000 views,1
de bruyne brilliant as always nice to see haaland can get the assists as well as the goals,1
kevin de bruyne world class as usual haaland shouldve at least gotten on the scoresheet if foden squared him in but at least he got an assist he can still find a way to contribute without goals,1
that first half was a masterclass by kdb and that goal using the outside of his foot was terrific,1
mlb needs more players like bauer he’s entertaining and makes watching the game fun,1
0457 i did this playing soccer for my high school during a game very memorable and always fun to think back on,1
caught that ball while feeding his boy like a champ,1
i first heard this in the car with my mother and my sister on a small obscure radio station we had no idea what it was and we laughed so hard we had to pull over one of my favourite memories,1
this is non ironically one of greatest pieces of art i ever seen,1
these guys should play at the opening ceremony of the tokyo olympics,1
the best part of this is that its the offical video but the vocals were clearly recorded live for this its not the recorded version in the album its messy and its awesome,1
one of my favorite songs my old roommatebestfriend and i would scream at the top of our lungs drunk out of our minds ill miss you everyday oliver rip,1
this is the ideal male body you may not like it but this is what peak performance looks like,1
5952 im honestly impressed by the time and effort you put into these videos keep it up ,1
congrats winnipeg open and jr open programs,1
i hope they keep adding sports always had a blast with boxing,1
this game looks fantastic it originally seemed like a barebones sequel to the wii games but its shaping up to be a really fun experience character customization tons of modes great music and visuals online and free updates im happy hopefully more sports will be added beyond golf id love to see baseball and boxing make a return,1
this game looks great i cant wait to play it the badminton especially looks like it will be a lot of fun and the survival bowling is such a cool idea will definitely be buying this when it comes out,1
when it comes to in game customization i go crazy for it so far from what i’ve seen if that in this game i’m super hyped,1
i absolutely loved baseball in wii so i hope it comes as a dlc since golf is coming i really hope they continue adding sports,1
it’s crazy how this is my mostanticipated game right now i always wanted a more fleshed out version of wii sports and this looks to be it hopefully we get some of the resort sports added later on,1
i mostly want this due to the customization i would love to see some nintendo themed outfits in the game maybe as prizes for online events it would be cool to wear splatoon outfits or dress up as mario characters for example,1
would be cool to see more sports getting in the game via updates would love to see waterpolo surfing kayaking as water based sports ice hockey skiïng and snowboarding as winter sports but also skating skateboarding basketball baseball as more summer based sports i could see a very special potential for other uses for the leg strap like keeping in balance in surfing and snowboarding making a triangle shape to break in skiïng and do some tricks like flips in skateboarding,1
one of the biggest things i had against this game was the lack of miis but its nice to see that theyre here i will definitely buy this game,1
i hope they add more sports i feel like a lot of the current ones are pretty similar so it would be nice to see some new ones come in,1
that girl chugging the beer is pretty loyal lol,1
love it i just could not stop laughing,1
i cant stop laughing with all those cute animals on the field ,1
zach hample eating it is classic hahahaha,1
i absolutely played with utah in video games what was lebron talking about the 9798 jazz were unstoppable in video games,1
loved the season opener look back as a kid who went the games with my pops he worked at byu his entire career 40 years always had season tickets my dad passed away last october with a long painful battle with cancer with all the ugly evil things going on on the world byu football basketball was our time to just hangout and enjoy being together although my dad was a little to crazy dealing with traffic and parking ,1
team jesus  comment down below if your on his winning team ,1
finally finally a properly done highlight video no annoying commentating and no useless history on the players or the plays play after play after play awesome job,1
the simpson flip really is incredible looks like something youd see in a movie about someone gaining super powers and taking advantage of it by playing football,1
i’m not a golf fan but that putt is one of the most impressive things i’ve ever seen in sports,1
i thought i was going to end up skimming or closing out this video early but this video was very well edited i was hooked on each play back to back without feeling bored the audio also was well balanced too and didnt have to worry about the next play being too loud or too soft just like what drummer386 said a couple months ago awesome job,1
also the missed free throw by steven adams to get the rebound and immediately know where westbrook was to pass it to him was amazing he knew exactly where he was and they were able to get a shot off from the miss before the other team even knew what happened lol,1
has one of the most incredible plays in golf ever commentators wow… nice,1
336 never gets old the very definition of situational awareness,1
that forward flip where he partially vaults off the other player is amazing even if you could practice for a thing like that itd still be hard to pull off,1
the reality is that when he was at ajax ten hag didnt choose the players at ajax they have a solid recruitment area full of great ex players at manchester united,1
casemiro would be a fabulous signing for us i can’t bear to watch mctominay play again,1
dont sleep on brighton i would like to see them in europe one day,1
brighton looking good even though they lost couple good players,1
moi and pervis and hopefully if sarmiento picks his level up i hope these three ecuadorian men play together they sure will do a high offensive playing style,1
brighton doing everything right very good team,1
probably the best game ive seen from harry maguire in a long time his absence from the game was pivotal in uniteds win,1
ten hag was on the pitch 45 minutes before the warmup placing cones and balls in precise spots his body language was full of intensity and concentration he looked like a man on a mission,1
this is a good coach hes clearly a floor general and knows how to drive results this is the guy you want you to lead your team especially if they have been so illdisciplined like united has for the last few years if this was basketball he is the type of point guard you want hes got excellent standards and definitely the mindset of a champion,1
as a liverpool fan i have to say that i admire how ten hag approached this game he is great to listen to honest and intelligent not afraid to leave out some big egos for the greater interest of the team respect,1
ten hag has found the best position for maguire not a single forward passed him not a single mis passed ball not a single foul not a single defensive error leading to goal keep it up maguire,1
so refreshing to have a manager whos not afraid to make big decisions,1
the tactical position of maguire was class ,1
i loved ten hags comment the other day about he has always had slow starts at every club he managed but he always got the job done he has total belief in himself it showed on the pitch last night that the players have belief now too,1
that “look at me now” gave me chills it really shows what he has been through to get there big congratulations,1
“look at me now” what an iconic speech the whole thing,1
the most amazing thing about this is how leon shone on the mic hes never been regarded as much of a talker but this might be best post fight interview ever its got it all cold one liners tear jerking passion a roaring crowd and bedlam in the stadium watched this so many times already,1
every time he says look at me now i feel it happy for him ,1
leon has done the uk proud all the hurdles he’s had in his career all the doubters and to silence everyone and beat the p4p number 1 was great to see ,1
this has me hyped for work about to clock in and scream “you’s all thought i’d be late look at me now” congrats leon,1
the name “rocky” couldn’t possibly be more fitting absolutely amazing win faced with such adversity,1
its amazing how arsenal is finally playing so well they dont have to rely on running the game though saka saliba jesus and zinchenko are also such a fresh injection to this team,1
can we get a second season of all or nothing with arsenal i would love to see how players are reacting behind the scenes,1
xhaka as a player summarizes arsenals rebirth absolutely love that we kept him,1
tim howard just keeps getting better and better as a pundit wasn’t impressed by him at first but he’s slowly growing on me,1
for once in a very long time it feels great to be a gooner,1
the fans support of saliba is unreal going back to the own goal last week the whole fan base wants him to succeed he could have an amazing career,1
arteta finally getting some credibility if partley stays healthy and jesus keeps his form arsenal can challenge city for the title,1
the result is better than what was expected arsenal are performing better than anticipated the next actual challenge is villa not man u,1
can we get a second season of all or nothing with arsenal i would love to see how players are reacting behind the scenes,1
such an awesome collection of cars for this year’s car magazine sports car giant test – but which is your favourite comment below…,1
a collection of brilliant cars but i would go for the gt4rs you cant beat a high revving normally aspirated engine,1
gt4rs with the mclaren a very close second for mei simply believe the porshe is way more versatile and at the same time affordable too whilst putting the same smile on my face,1
great video guys this channel definitely deserves more subs than a lot of other car review channels its the gt4rs for me here with the 296 a close second,1
well done car magazine but i will take porsche state of art on wheels,1
id love any of those with the exception of the lotus in this company it looks outclassed in every department for me the one that offers the best combination of performance desirability and of being obtainable would be the maserati,1
how gorgeous is the mc20 in comparison to the 296 i love the rear 34 of the 296 but its just ugly from the front the mc20 with a mc12 livery would be my choice i think would need the opfs removed though to get some better sound out of it or the lotus and pay off my house p p,1

impossible not to love mitrovic he plays with so much passion,1
two teams with two classic cf players strong physical and dominant in the air great match premier league needs more strikers like mitrovic and toney,1
mitrovic just sores up on headers it’s nearly unstoppable for smaller players,1
fulham could easily stay up along with forest,1
first goal for brentford was a masterpiece loved it mitrovic is a killer,1
everyone doubted fulham but they’re looking favorites to stay up,1
as a spurs fan congrats fulham and i hope you play another priemer league next season to survive,1
he’s playing in goal for my team any day however many legs he’s got i don’t care i love this man,1
that one legged goalie is teaching us more than any other video on youtube,1
the vasy clip was a normal game for him thats the big cat go bolts,1
that 1 lag man  absolutely legend hats off melt my heart,1
really awesome moments great video,1
we were doing backhans sweeps in waterpolo when i was in hs nothing spectacular other than we were strong,1
333 as per george carlin i believe that shot is worth 25 points,1
the cyclist was incredible made me jump out of my seat,1
gabriel jesus has seriously fit into this squad like a glove two goals and two assist is amazing saka looked a bit quiet today but it’s probably due to his fitness not being up to speed this early on zinchenko did good and marteneli fried fofona who looks like he’s about ti go for 80 millif we get another signing i’ll be happy this team is looking very promising,1
love the start of this season so far arsenal need to keep their confidence up in order to take control over games and win them coyg,1
you can still see how saliba is solid even after the miscommunication mistake what a gem,1
the fans clapping for saliba after the own goal said it all for me the fans are behind this group great win the score line could’ve been much higher coyg,1
gabriel jesus has been amazing for arsenal hes merged quickly into this arsenal side playing magnificently arsenal by the looks of it have a good season ahead of them,1
the chemistry and youth of this arsenal squad is crazy top four finish this year and if they improve even further then theyll definitely compete with city and liverpool next season,1
xhaka had a really good game criticize him when it’s justified no doubt but you also have to praise him when he deserves it goal assist,1
gabriel jesus really showing pep that they didn’t need to look for anyone “better” he’s pure class at any club he goes to,1
will be interesting to see how far arsenal’s defense will take them this year they have plenty of offense,1
i love how the arsenal fans applauded saliba when he scored an own knowinng that if that ball goes beyond him to vardy it is a goal best fans in the pl,1

the respect he shows every ingredient is amazing sushi is part art and part food in my eyes every step is so precise,1
im never going to attempt to do homemade sushi but loved watching a true master of his craft do it,1
taka might just be my favourite chef that’s been on this channel which is impressive since i have many other favourites he’s so engaging and i felt so welcome to try out what he’s teaching us i’d love more videos with him,1
such elaborate techniques ive been trying to make rolls for a while with not much success theyre delicious but unsightly lol and it will be very interesting trying to recreate at least some of these,1
ive seen a lot of content on sushi making and eating over the decades and this was by far one of the most profound and stuffed with knowledge great content even though the closed captions apparently didnt know what a sinew is and made it a sinu whatever that is,1
perfect timing just tried making sushi for the first time last night,1
happy sunday everyone after finishing my living room makeover to wanted to go over some common living room design mistakes i see and how to fix them i hope this gives you some tips and ideas you can apply in your living room,1
i know i love mismatched furniture one of the ways i’ve been looking to accomplish this is by using slip covers amazon has some great ones with a variety of colors and patterns and very affordable ,1
love your videos kristen so brilliantly put together and such a lot of fantastic tips thank you very much ,1
hi kristen in your videos youve talked about grounding your furniture by using a large rug which looks great what if i have carpet is there anything i would need to incorporate to make the furniture appear grounded in this situation ,1
i would love some tips to decorate a small but high ceiling living room its been a struggle to find inspiration,1
hi kristen i love your design tips my husband is insisting on getting a recliner sofa can i mix them with fabric accent chairs and do the furniture in the living room have to be of same height,1
love the advice you give this is something i need to do in my living room nice work,1
love your contents will definitely consider your tips in my room design journey thanks a bunch,1
great video as always loved the tv nestled within the gallery wall good idea also i love every opportunity to look at your living room you did a fabulous job on that room one of my favorites,1
kristen youre like the only youtuber i constantly watch i feel like i connect with you in so many ways,1
hes right ive always loved studying the gestures and language of appealing characters and i come across as confident most of the times to the point where people are surprised when i tell them i have anxieties and various inner struggles like we all do its not about feeling perfect its about knowing you deserve to be where youre at and accepting that you might feel uncomfortable at times,1
i think fake it till you make it is really important when it comes to confidence you need to practice it in order for it to start coming naturally appearing confident even when you dont feel confident i believe can prevent confrontation or becoming a victim in some circumstances,1
honestly i feel like confidence comes naturally when you care about something so much that you are no longer sensitive to how people see you and how you appear in front of others like jane goodall or colin powell im a person that has a mission thats important to me plus huge experience and knowledge that built me and im proud and what the world thinks is not my concern,1
confidence can be very quiet finally someone said it thank you,1
i was born confident and as a little girl i was constantly scolded for being too bold or outspoken now i own it again and found joy in life like when i was true to myself,1
the presenter here delivers his knowledge succinctly he is the example of what he is teaching thank you for a concise no extraneous lesson it is has been immensely helpful,1
i have adhd so usually its hard for me to focus on talks speeches and so on but when someone is really good at speaking and confident about what theyre saying i tend to pay more and even full attention i paid full attention to this video and even remember what i learned after watching only once this is my 2nd time here just to make sure i dont forget,1
to me confidence means being happy with who you are having that inner peace with the person you are,1
he’s definitely someone who can make you admit everything just by his personality,1
im glad that those signs he laid out at the beginning were myths ive put so much effort over the years into avoiding showing these signs by accident so i dont come across as untrustworthy and when i do them by accident i always felt like im somehow maliciously deceiving people or myself without knowing about it this puts my mind at ease selfsoothing if you will,1
this is the most interesting thing ive seen in a long time i can feel this guys passion and attention to detail the way he described seeing pertinent nonverbals jumping out at you as if a caricature when played at double speed was incredibly perceptive im so intensely interested in this individual and his affinity to human behavior,1
i lived 2 years in paris and i used to observe a lot in the metro their outfit i noticed that blue beige and grey were the colors most used to dress no patterns only simple color so simple and stylish at the same time it is the opposite of us italians we like be noticed by accessories or colors i prefer the french style,1
i love what camielle said about french girls finding what suits them their body and what they like and dressing according to that not following trends but buying staple pieces that will fit your wardrobe and last a long time i really love that fast fashion has ruined our sense of style some people only buy a piece because its trendy then the trend passes and they forget about that item and throw it out and the cycle continues with the next trend,1
“it’s nice to have a bag that doesn’t scream designer” well i have a wardrobe full of clothes that don’t even whisper designer y’all it makes me so happy that i made you laugh ,1
i love how they are like actual friends talking over each other interrupting each other not listening the little laughs i love it,1
shes so on point with french styles they dont follow trends but stay to the classics with some accents of edginess or accents of new trends but the root is classic and simple,1
this girl really has an aussie feel to me funny that she’s britishfrench which you can see in ways but so much of her reminds me of my australian friends,1
always good to hear your thoughtful and logical analysis i dont care about bullish or bearish market trade a small percentage of your portfolio rather than going in and out every couple weeks trying to time the market trading went smooth for me as i was able to raise over 84 btc when i started at 3 btc in just few weeks implementing richard and tips,1
this was a fantastic talk its a topic we are all somewhat aware of but we need to dive deeper like this individual thank you sir,1
very well put i love how ted talks are short but convey meaningful messages,1
030 true in college i wrote a 25 page term paper and in error turned in the draft with a bunch of typos grammer errors run on sentences spelling errors etc the first couple paragraphs were fine so when it got retuned it was graded a with a good work handwritten by the professor obviously and luckily for me he didnt bother reading past the first sentence,1
this was great i am a freelance content writer and ive been implementing these strategies from the beginning because its very true great talk,1
nicholas carr described this scanning vs deep reading phenomenon in great detail in his 2010 book the shallows what the internet is doing to our brains and is worth a read for anyone with further interest and he provides provocative evidence it changes the mechanism our brain uses to process and store information,1
that hit home im so guilty of spending hours writinganswering emails etc with what i would think makes me sound strong intelligent and a force to be respected and would read them back to myself countless times to see how good l lookedl loved this talk and will totally change now kiss keep it simple stupid,1
i dont have time it is not a priority time is elastic time is a choice totally agreed thank you so much for the talk,1
this is hands down one of best talks i have heard thanks for such a wonderful lesson,1
well i have finished watching it and i found it really useful here are some lessons i learnt i dont have time it is not a priority time is a choice it is elastic we have enough time almost all of us make the experiences enjoyable such as you can read or listen to a book while commuting get rid of things that take away most of your time on a daily basis focus on what matters and you will build the live you want,1
make yourself a threecategory priority list for the coming week career relationships self and there should be 23 items in each category small moments can have great power you can use your bits of time for bits of joy even if we are busy we have time for what matters quoting her,1
we dont build the lives we want by saving time we build the lives we want and time saves itself ,1
every minute i spend is my choice how great is this sentence,1
i love this womans attitude shes funny captivating and interesting too for me step 1 of controlling my time would be to stop watching youtube though,1
repeat after me its safe to set boundaries with difficult people no matter what they say or feel i am safe,1
this puts a whole new perspective on the way i think about others actions and my reactions i cant change people but i can change the way i think and feel and also asking questions is another good point very well said,1

the thief is so smart in this game it was almost like cinema summary was guiding him throughout this entire death game,1
i love how in the triangle room game instead of just ignoring the dumbest person in the room they used his imagination and creativity to figure out the solution,1
this guy’s definetly a genius,1
the best thing i started doing to wake up is to leave my phone on my desk across the room so i cant be on my phone before bed and i have to stand up to turn off my alarm just forcing myself to stand up in the morning stops me from snoozing my alarm,1
just so you know im from brazil and this video saved me thank you finally the algorithm got the recommendation right,1
i was constantly exhausted no matter how much i ate or slept it was affecting my job my workouts at the gym even my free time i felt terrible like i was sick or something i finally went to the doctor and found out i had an iron deficiency so my doctor put me on supplements and offered me an infusion and i feel so much better so its definitely worth getting bloodwork done and going to the doctors on top of all these great tips,1
i’m a nurse i work night shift but even working nights following these tips is so important for me some people think i’m crazy for staying on a night schedule even on my days off but it’s like you said it’s so hard on your body to not just stay on one schedule my blackout curtains sleep mask extended release melatonin are my best friends after a shift a hot shower,1
there was one single semester in undergrad that i was able to set my schedule up so that everyday i had a class start at 1000 a regular lunch break and evening classes that ended by 6 and my dorm happened to be a single with a lot of windows and natural light having a consistent schedule that matched my night owl rhythm and light regulation was the best sleep i ever felt it was also the most consistent i’ve ever been in the gym since quitting high school sports followed by a semester where classes started at either 830 or 2pm on alternate days and my worst semester both grade and mentalhealth wise,1
great advice all of it im one of those you mentioned near then end with a medical condition sleep isnt rejuvenating for some no matter how much we get working towards good sleep habits is still helpful as it regulates our lives and helps us pace what minimal energy we have so if youre reading this comment no matter if youre chronically ill like i am or just a tired person without a debilitating illness practice good sleep habits be patient itll help,1
just what ive been looking for,1
love how to survive  useful,1
this will be useful for future,1
i am almost at my 20th hour of watching tedx talks and i have to say i am getting pretty good at this,1
this is 110 correct looking back on every skill ive learned and accounted my hours for it is around the 15 20 hour range that i feel i got the hang of this and that the dream isnt foolish but by practice and repetition the perception becomes reality,1
the main barrier is not intellectual its emotional was taken to heart thanks for the video,1
1030 1115 is the life changing quote for me trying to be a perfectionist at everything and eventually procrastinating is the thing that im doing over these years thank you ,1
what i learned is we need to be able to deconstruct the skill and learn enough to self assess our progress eliminating diseraction while practice time and put our 20 hours this was so excellent,1
the best most exciting most practical most fascinating ted talk that i continue to come back to you again and again read the book multiple times applied it to everything from learning a new language to fixing up my house to now developing my skills as a ham radio operator thank you so much for this,1
this makes learning something more digestible instead of getting overwhelmed by the task so right wish i watched this earlier in my life ’,1
love it put 20 hours practice in it and have fun thinking about my karate journey 2hrs×10weeks here i am feeling much more comfortable compared the stressful emotion at the middle now the next learning is about c programming for a r5 module problem love the idea of selfcorrection milestone and the dedication of 20 hours practice my comment about the 20 hours is that its just the practice time it doesnt include 3 also very important things the preparation time the decomposing time and the reflection time,1
i know you dont read your comments gordon however ive just practiced making rice and it turned out better than anticipated 50g of rice and 150ml of cold water and i followed the method you described you did say 8 to 10 minutes and i gave it 9 the result was extremely satisfactory and i combined it with some leftovers and have had a lunch with no waste i know how to do the onion as my daughter has already shown me im off out shortly to buy a steel as i usually sharpen my knife on a whetstone which can be more of a chore than using a steel im 61 and everyday is a schoolday ive so wanted to master rice cheers,1
amazing energy he makes me actually want to cook his enthusiasm is contagious and this just pasta and simple stuff cant imagine the level of passion he exudes on a complicated dish,1
i would trust gordon ramsay with my life 247 its like everything he does he just does it with purpose and he gives it 110 each time,1
one of the reasons i like gordon is he seems genuinely enthusiastic about cooking and super happy to teach you what he knows his vibe isnt ooh im a fancy chef i know better than you its cooking is fun lets do it together you did something ive never tried how cool,1
this is the first video ive saw before i started cooking more frecuently thanks gordon youre a great teacher,1
this is the first video ive saw before i started cooking more frecuently thanks gordon youre a great teacher,1

hi jatz thank you for another valuable video question what if amazon tells me to request for an approval to list a product this is after step where i search over asin number and choose condition of the product it tells me to attach invoice for at least 10 items so it means i have to have the product already bought in order to proceed with any listing,1

love your honesty i started a blog in college too roll tide but that was 2009 i was never really consistent until now your videos helped me realize how important consistency is ,1
thank you so much for sharing all of your tips and tricks you are seriously such an inspiration i am currently trying to start my own blog and it is harder than i thought it would be to juggle school work and starting a blog i am so grateful for your content and everything that you share,1
sophia you are such an inspiration thank you for being radically honest and giving tips that are actually very helpful ive been binging your content and plan on building a blog this year cheers to 2022 lets get this bread,1
one of my favorite video series please keep them coming youre such an inspiration to a lot of people im in the middle of starting and restarting my blog social media presence my biggest downfall is consistency but hopefully now that my little one is in school ill have more time thank you again love love love your blog and videos they truly motivate me,1
watching your videos feels like taking a great course in itself thanks sophia ,1
you are right about pinterest i have 60k monthly visitors and only now starting a blog and looking for advice and i agree about the classes and also learning from others are are already successful and implementing their strategies to your blog well done i wish i had had the capability to start a blog when i was in college 80s girl ty sophia beautiful presentation easy to understand your points are well made,1
love love your courses btw i highly recommend anyone to do it if you are on the fence about it this is our year babes ps sophia i’d love to see more videos about your design biz 3,1
the most genuine and real advice about blogging i have found seriously so encouraging and straightforward,1
believing that no matter what happens you’re going to be fine anyway is always a great mindset to have,1
youll stop worrying that someone will reject you because youll never reject yourself that is brilliant well done,1
realizing that no matter what happens ill be okay is exactly how i survived my childhood i used to stress so much then after so many dramatic plot twists i realized if i survived all that i will survive whatever else comes my way and thats when i stopped stressing as much i hadnt really connected it with confidence before but i can see the connection now interesting ,1
one thing this video misses and probably the one most important thing is that confidence comes from within you can stand in any way you want dress as fancy as you like and have enough money to make king solomon blush but if inside you’re still insecure the world will see it love yourself know you’re worthy and never let the outside effect or diminish the inside don’t try and be or imitate someone else be who you are and love it one thing this video gets right know you’re gonna be ok no matter what ‘nough said love to you all xxx,1
you reach true confidence by letting everything go,1
if you spend time getting to know yourself and learn to love and accept that person then you strengthen the most important relationship of your life the one you have with yourself if that relationship is solid then you always have an inner safe haven no matter what is going on around you that self love and understanding allows you to stay true to yourself in every situation that is the deepest form of confidence,1
this is the most incredibleunderstandable video on confidence ive came across by far keep it up honestly,1

ann im 47 and when i was little my mom would take me to the public library there was a wonderful woman that would read stories to the children and give the adults time to find what they needed she would read fantasy books with dragons and fairies it was such an amazingly positive time in my life you sound just like her and when you are making something or saving something you give me that same feeling of wonder and joy watching you work your magic this is one of the best channels on all of youtube thank you ann for everything you do,1
this series gives me confidence that theres always a way for you to mess up and theres always a way for you to make it better so be hopeful everyone and thank you ann ,1
one of my favorite cakes my mother ever made started out as a near fail it was a cheesecake that had cracked down the middle we had blueberries growing in our yard so she took a bunch that wed already picked cooked them down into a thick jelly and poured it into the crack as i recall she called it grand canyon blueberry cheesecake,1
the pool cake was so cute put an appropriate toy depending on what character your child is currently obsessed with im 20 and i would still absolutely love to get a cake like that,1
as soon as hyper realistic cakes came up my first thought was sideserf i love that you made sure to point out that she has problems with her videos being stolen and uncredited to spread the word to new audiences its why she uses the fluorescent green icing now i love watching all your content but it just mesmerises me when you bake 3,1
just woke up at 6am nothing like an upload from ann to start off our fridays the effort you put into every single video you make is just chefs kiss easily the most informative and creative baking channel i know and it goes so far beyond that as youve shown time and time again,1
the transformation of these cakes are mind blowing,1
ann im so glad you stepped in to be the aussie mum the world needed have you ever thought about doing an episode on traditional australian bakes like lamingtons anzac biscuits pavlovas etc theyre good recipes for new bakers also maybe find an old cwa cookbook and follow the recipes especially when australia still had rations,1
imagine being ann’s friend that’s already a treat i couldn’t imagine being sick and her being her amazing self by delivering a delicious cake to mei hope your friend is feeling better,1
i love the rescue videos especially because ann tells us how to avoid the fail in the first place and then also shows us how to fix it 3,1
i wanna learn more magic,1
amazing i will surely try 10 of them,1
mind blowing magician got talent,1
very great moves ,1

housekeeper here i really thought these were going to be ridiculous but a lot of them are actually pretty good tips some of them are a little extra like don’t go to the trouble of blending up dried grapefruit peel and mixing it with baking soda just make a paste with baking soda lemon juice and white vinegar also i don’t think flying round while mopping the floors is a hack maybe just take off your shoes,1
nice  useful video thanks ,1
wow soy super fan de este canal ,1

she’s a natural this was a great ted talk truly worth every minute,1
i am 37 and finally realizing that i have to invest in my self and mental health or else it will be my demise i have made drastic changes and by sticking to them and not feeling guilty i am definitely looking and feeling better,1
if you dream regardless of age you will continue to be young,1
at a time where we’re being told especially as women that you don’t matter after 25 and you should live for a man or your childrenthis conversation is so necessary well done bevy ,1
i’m in a transitional phase of my life at 51 and bevy’s talk was just what i needed,1
in the most perfect timing this came to me i am certainly at a point in my life where i’m choosing me i’m rediscovering what i love and advocating for myself and making choices without regret it’s liberating and as always a journey of unknowns but i am certain that i will live my life and not be miserable,1
i’m in a transitional point in life at 50 as i discover what i’m most passionate about…what’s next for me bevy’s talk was inspiring and right on time cheers to “it gets greater later”,1
loved this talk 1who am i at my core 2how am i being perceived 3how do i love to be perceived,1
it’s so inspiring yet very entertaining i feel i needed to watch this i’m only 26yo but i’ve felt like my life is about to end because i haven’t had many chances but lately i’ve realized i need some inner healing and know myself better and i’ve been in that pathway since last year gonna put those questions in practice to not forget who i’m looking for myself ,1
319 i’m also super sorry but i almost popped my left eardrum laughing so hard and fell of my bed almost when she said “smooth as a baby’s butt” lmaooooo but anyways awesome,1

329 the girl who had a “forest” under her arms was really enjoying that dance,1

hey me and my little cousin have been watching u for years now and we rlly hope u notice ,1
this has been one of your best videos yet dude keep up the great work,1
ddoi is such an educational channel without him humans would never grow thumbs,1
the way that kid toss the chalk away when he finished writing is golden also a dragon fruit is the fruit of a cactus plant prickly pear is also another delicious one,1
the duck going for a swim and the service dog pushing the wheelchair are the cutest things ive seen all day,1
for those wondering the way how honey pot ants get their abdomens so big with fluids it done by feeding a freshly emerged adult ant tons of food while their exoskeleton is still soft this allows the gaster to stretch bigger than normal leading to how the ants become so plump they do this because if a shortage of food comes the other ants can get it from the ants that store it in their large abdomens called repletes it really is fascinating thing to see happen,1
as the pinned comment already said i think this was one of your coolest videos it had a lot of weird but cool and fascinating clips i really enjoy watching your content,1
the fruit from the cactus is actually pretty decent it’s been a few years since i’ve last tried it but sometimes it can be kinda tangy if i remember correctly,1
ddoi never fails to impress me keep up the great work,1
in this day and age my life has become complicated especially my social and digital life i always wondered how to simplify it somehow thank you for making this video,1
“very little is needed to make a happy life it is all within yourself in your way of thinking” marcus aurelius meditations,1
the biggest thing ive realized lately is that the more money you have the more money you will want to spend so you never really feel like you have enough thats why i really like the idea mentioned in this video of learning how to be satisfied with what you already have this is especially true of us in the first world we get carried away by envy and comparison and believe the lie that other people live happier lives than us because they have all this stuff that they are living the dream but the fact is that the only reason they have all this stuff is because they are stressed out all the time trying to maintain their excessive lifestyles and if they stopped pushing to get more and more stuff then they would realize that happiness was already within their reach the irony is that people in the third world that come to live in the first world have a tendency to become like this the most they have lived their whole lives in poverty feeling envy for those in the first world who have everything they need so when they come to live here and get a job they carry their envy with them and buy into the lie that they need more and more stuff their family back home wonder why they are so stingy in sending money but the family doesnt realize that the cost of living is much higher where we live you never feel like you have enough,1
perfect video as always ez in todays day age every person needs to remove excess baggage from ones life and embrace the idea of simplification both sense and simplicity are the two most significant aspects of our lives,1
i just love how this video is an amalgamation of all the past videos you have produce so far thanks again for this wonderful food for the thought eizelgänger ,1
thank you einzelganger for these mentally nutritious videos that you make for us to feed our minds peace,1
good summary when i crave something i imagine as realistically as possible that i already have it this helps me know if i really want it,1
that last point is really true its not about simplifying all aspects of life just for its own sake rather the point is for a more tranquil life thanks for the video,1
i love your channel the technical details are perfect i’m an engineer and i work with batteries as a hobby there are two kinds of batteries that are lion one is “protected” and the other is “unprotected” the protected ones prevent overcharging and overdischarging as well as over current the unprotected ones do not and rely on external protection guess which people choose for their vaping lithium ion batteries have a huge energy density they are damaged by over charging and over discharging cheap chargers don’t behave and will over charge few if any vaping tools have protection for over discharge so why don’t people use protected cells generally those have too low current to make vaping possible the current draw to instantly heat to 200c is a lot of current and generally the protection on the cell would kick in causing things to not work or work much more slowly,1
crazy how this series went from kinda lightheartedly debunking ice cream icing and coke watermelon lifehacks to discussing about actually lifethreatening stuff thank you ann youre doing amazing work 3,1
thank you for the face,1
keep up the good work idatchy,1
yayyy ty,1
cool,1
omg best video ever ty idatchy,1
it looks weird to me to have the whites be so smooth and perfect this method seems to preserve the whites the best although it requires more water and vinegar than other techniques ive been using alton browns technique and it works better than the classic vortex method but this one looks even easier,1
ooh outsciencing heston cant wait to give this a go for lunch tomorrow i really like the concept and how practical it is for preparing large numbers of eggs,1
great tip ive added vinager to the poaching water and when doing multiple eggs used rings to hold the individual eggs in place which can shape them kind of ugly into rounds compared to yours ive used small tuna tins that i cut the top and bottom off of for this pre soaking in vinager is much smarter too,1
i already am comfortable poaching an egg i even own egg laying chickens but i am so happy and excited to try this method you are absolutely right i have seen tons of poaching videos and this is a unique technique,1
so wonderful cant wait to try some perfect poached eggs soon ,1
ill remember this for the next time i host brunch for a large group there are tons of great tips in here to help get a lot of eggs on the table at the same time if youre only making three or four eggs this method seems like overkill i add a few tablespoons of vinegar to the simmering water and crack one egg at a time into a ramekin so that i can very gently add it to the water as long as the eggs are fresh it works every time,1
incredible method after 10 years as a chef i thought i tried every way possible to poach eggs and this one is by far the best tried it this morning it works flawlessly 1010 thanks for this tip ,1
seriously most useful video ive watched in a long time,1
i learned this very trick from a fantastic french chef early on in my cooking career and it is a game changer for poached eggs,1
if building a second brain sounds interesting to you and youd like to know more you can buy tiagos book on amazon here  or take it further and join tiagos building a second brain course,1
this is one of the very best recaps of the building a second brain method ali fantastic job to you and your team  it was so much fun collaborating together and i hope we do it again,1
summary notes 0000 intro the problem of information overload leads to a need for a system to help manage and organize information the second brain system helps solve the problem of information overload by providing a framework for organizing and storing information the second brain system has helped ali in his own life and can hopefully help others as well the second brain system uses code as an acronym to explain its core foundations capture organize distill express 0041 what is a second brain and why should you have one a second brain is a digital system for capturing and organizing ideas building a second brain can help you express your creativity be more productive and make better decisions every job today involves knowledge work of some kind and a second brain can help you with inputting processing and outputting information the methodology for building a second brain has four parts capture organize distill and express code 0456 c capture ali discusses different ways of capturing information both manually and automatically ali captures his thoughts and ideas in apple notes he also has a system for automatically capturing highlights from books articles and podcasts having a good capture system helps reduce stress levels by freeing up your brain from having to remember everything ali recommends using a note taking system to store thoughts and ideas that come to mind throughout the day as well as highlights from books articles and podcasts 0832 o organise ali suggests organizing information by actionability rather than topic in order to be more targeted and efficient in ones learning this means that when you come across something relevant you add it to the project folder related to the action you plan to take rather than creating a new category for it you can still search for specific information using control f or command f if needed this system is especially helpful when working on longterm projects with many moving parts 1107 d distill ali talks about a method called progressive summarization which is basically like highlighting but on steroids this is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important different than highlighting were used to in school its not particularly effective for retention in your own personal brain but it is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important 1145 e express the e in the second brain system stands for express meaning that once you have captured and organized your ideas you need to share them with the world in some way sharing your ideas allows you to receive feedback collaborate with others and ultimately create something tangible that is the output of all of your hard work without expressing our ideas they are essentially useless its important to find a way to share your creativity with others 1309 how my second brain has helped ali the coursebook has helped ali become more productive but also more creative and less stressed in general the system taught ali the idea of slow burns versus heavy lifts working on multiple projects simultaneously so that when it comes time to actually finish one most of the work is already done the system has also helped with his teaching work he can easily prepare talks with just a few minutes notice by referencing his stored information,1
i am eagerly waiting for alis first ted talk it would be amazing i wonder what topic he will speak on,1
having a second brain is no joke i am currently using notion to perfect this great video ali definetly devouring all of the information you are putting out ,1
now this is my favourite video i have been struggling a lot when it comes to handling multiple projects thanks ali you really answered a lot of my questions today,1
im so happy about this book im reading it right now am on page 90 and its already changing my digital life thank you tiago forte ,1
thanks for this ali and team it really helps break down the process of thinking to have a 2nd brain ive been calmer with my projects since listening to you and i grow ever more productive with my schedule and life in general as for the video idea perhaps you can make a video on how to deal with burn outs i believe burnouts burn creativity you want to push but you just mentally cant ive dealt with it in the past but im getting out of it now since the company i want to work for actually hit me up to work with them it gave me a boost,1
your book club series is one of the most useful series on youtube i have a commonplace book in evernote and im always amazed at the gems ive come across over the years you spinning around by a hot tub when you were talking about selfcare is such a vibe love the idea of organising ideas according to actionability felt called out by hoarding your ideas thank you for this breakdown of the book ali noted as a must read and i also need to work expressing my finds,1
theres a game where you can roleplay as the monsters the game is called accurate rainbow friends roleplay have fun playing it,1
personally i would just play accurate rainbow friends roleplay instead of spending 50 robux in it in a other game plus in accurate rainbow friends rp it actually gives you the real mao and all the details,1
congratulations to everybody who is early and found this comment,1
hear me go on a rant nic these are literally friday night funkin morphs not the actual rainbow friends morphs thats why theres a sing option because friday night funkin is a rhythm game its a really cool game you should check it out sometime,1
sometimes when you are in a dark place you think that you are buried but you have actually been planted if you are going through that hard time just know that i am cheering for you,1
to absorb what one reads its crucial to master concentration when i started reading in my early youth my mind would wander before finishing a page over time my concentration improved to a point where i could read dozens of pages without losing my train of thought activities like chess reading and meditation are effective in improving concentration i know a buddhist monk who can clear his mind for long periods even when in a noisy environment its a skill that he developed over time with practice and discipline its literally rewired his brain schools fail miserably in teaching our youth in the art of self learning,1
i was born into a relatively poor family never had the opportunity to go to college i became obsessed with the self learning technique right out of high school i happened to live in a town that had one of the top 10 business schools in the us i would go to the university library and pour over the text books in the order they were taught within 18 months i had the knowledge of an mba by the time i was 20 i started my own company and was a millionaire before i turned 40 it took so long because when a guy with no formal education walks into a bank for a loan they tend to want to laugh at you i finally found a banker that would talk to me i explained my business model and told him how the current inverted yield curve would effect the time value of the money i would borrow he was floored,1
be a teacher but forever a student listening in itself is a lost art so difficult to run across a good listener joe rogan comes to mind i really enjoy the interviews he has conducted with elon as his guest i dont necessarily agree with elon on many things but he seems sincere and takes his time trying to explain his thoughts what i like about joe is he gives his guests time to speak without interrupting them with his own beliefs or agenda like so many on the tell a vision being a good listener takes practice but well worth the effort,1
the most important thing for learning like musk says is understanding the fundamentals of whatever it is you want to understand always always always build a solid foundation and then everything else will make perfect sense,1
i love elon he makes it cool to be smart hes a genius,1
the saying goes “ a jack of all trades is a master of none but still always better than a master of one” so arguably elon is a good example rather than proving it wrong,1
as someone who was born in dhaka and learned about dhaka muslin as a kid seeing the fabric being covered here was a treat to remember thanks for shining light on it,1
my grandmother had a sari made of dhaka muslin i remember as a kid hugging her and remember how soft it was i miss her so much,1
i love the clarity and speed of your demonstration no wasted words you are very friendly and yet get to the point so well love the summary presentation is simple yet substantial which really helps me as i am new to cooking thank you so much for the quick and clear video everybody doing videos should follow suit,1
never knew stirfry could be so easy the way u explained it step by step with alternatives is awesome thank you definitely gonna give this a try thank you and god bless,1
this is great i like how you didn’t follow a recipe but you gave us a formula for it very helpful ,1
this woman should have her own cooking program she is incredibly likable and down to earth plus a recipe is very good with the upcoming disaster country could be headed for any expensive meals that are good for us should be kind of interest to all,1
well done i live in hawaii and we eat stir fry several times a week this is a very concise video and easy to follow,1
i cooked this last knight with noodles me and my 19 year old grandson loved it he even had a second helping too and even ate all the veggies which he never does thank you so much for sharing this with us ill be making this more often yummy ,1
thank you  you gave me the confidence i needed to make a stir fry you explained it very well everything looks good  i’m ready to wok and roll,1
i ran across this recipe today and i had all of the ingredients already made it for dinner tonight substituted steak in place of chicken omg this hit the spot ive eaten two helpings  thanks for sharing this recipe,1
i said this before but i love how you teach you always give great tips things we’d want to know,1
this is a great demonstration—clear and concise and a good length i love a good stirfry and appreciate the “template” you have giventhanks for sharing your knowledge i like your “personality” and felt like i was learning from a friend,1

this dude knows more about running a business at age 19 than anyone i know in business grad school salute daily,1

smart kid not many figure out the art of business rite off the rip this kid will be successful,1
hes spot on with that maintenance number of 20 ive owned my trucking company 4 years now and that figure has always worked someone taught this young man well hes wayyyyy ahead of the learning curve of this industry,1

he is 19 guys seriously instead of making positive comments you talk about how much he makes it’s not all about money in this life the kid is a good example for many of us out here,1
amazing interview startling how much he has done at such a young age good lessons on the virtues of hard work and resourcefulness must have had terrific parents at home to encourage and guide his endeavors,1

i’m late 17 and my business started really randomly and unexpectedly lol i wanted to buy some leather goods but the prices killed me so i was like “ya know what im cheap im gonna make my own stuff” and spent tons of time on youtube and google learning and messing up and leaning new things from the ways i messed up then my family was impressed by the finished result which surprised me and they told me i should start a business so i was like welp why not give it a shot and i’ve only very recently started but so far alhamdulillah i’ve been blessed and it’s going better than id imagined the beginning would go moral of the story is be cheap learn a skill from that cheapness and capitalize on that in my first week i made more than in a month at previous jobs i’ve had throughout high school and i’ve actually been able to enjoy it learn things while making money and look at all of my work and feel fulfilled and happy unlike any of my other jobs,1
love that he mentioned the willingness to learn to keep learning and the value of education when it comes to the language of business,1
if you decided to become an entrepreneur nothing will convince you other wise till you succeed you’re definitely an entrepreneur,1
feeling reassured after watching this i am a late entrepreneur 48 years old had been working in the same industry as my current business for past 20 years made enough money  now in my own company i am doing a to z right from making sales calls to project management one day i will make my mark like mr mark,1
as usual elon was right about everything,1
i read about a man in his 50s that started investing in stocks then retired in 2years with over 6million that right there is my utmost goal and id really appreciate clues and tips on how to reach this goal within 5years,1
thank you whistleblowers twitter fbi doj dhs please keep coming forward,1
this should be behind gated content i never ever take notes from presentations it feels like ive heard it all before but this one wow gold listen to this wonderful genius give it 20 minutes and i promise you you will be busy jotting down his words as well,1
to reach your potential you need to start working towards it investing remains the smartest way to prepare for the unexpected been in the space for 6yrs and extremely pleased with the decision i made the good news is its not too late,1
great video thanks for making it easier for me to understand much appreciated,1
great lesson true words,1
your explanation is realistic and straight to the point on the other hand there are many ways of manipulating the market i am glad as a small investor that i am putting my hard earned savings into the most better said the only transparent market there is day trading ive made over 7btc working with colette whitney lately,1
people never know how to avoid making mistake while trading you need to get full understanding and knowledge it is not something you just gamble mrs stacyconsistent and constructive i am getting thel best from it,1
thank you brian tracy ,1
great video but let me talk about something important i see many young and old make mistakes that i think should not be i believe that everyone young or old should have an investment plan that increases their financial returns from three figures to six figures the investment can be your retirement plan or future plan depending on what you want but what matters most is that you have an investment that is profitable,1
great video thank you to sharing with us wish you good luck and success,1
wow that was pretty brilliant information also the way you deliver is simply awesome thanks a lot for sharing,1
ive been a painting contractor for 35 years just me and my brother except for the first few years when the winter was a little tricky weve been super busy the whole time all residential we have a van a paint sprayer and a powerwasher and a bunch of ladders and basic other supplies get good at something nobody wants or has time to do and youll always be busy you must do excellent work as well all our customers are our sales agents it has a low overhead you can expand if you want with employees but that does make it a bit more complicated,1
sir had you mentioned the profitability in each of these business along with the headaches of maintenance like maximum in dump trucks additional knowledge required employees required etc your video would have been excellent by the way real estate rental business is the best with adding appreciation good luck,1
there is always a risk associated with starting a business i agree with this thats the reality not all of the businesses are most likely to succeed but it is always up to us whether to persevere for another day or to just give up it is important to build a business you are passionate and compassionate to continue every day dont forget to invest in your knowledge and your business improvement rather than on growing profits alone,1
awesome video thanks for the great information i own rentals too and love it it takes some time to figure things out but thats true of anything keep up the great work and look forward to more videos,1
well explained sir i am very excited about the prospect of using cryptocurrency not just as a money equivalent but using it as a way to earn something as a result of doing some type of work,1
where i live i have never seen a betting shop close down one round the corner from me has been open for over 50 years theres a constant stream of customers going into these places and even with internet competition they still seem to thrive betting shops is where i would strongly consider investing it cigarettes is another one bat share price just goes up and up warren buffet loves the tobacco industry and who can blame him with those huge profits even with all the bad write up about the dangers of smoking people still do it as its so highly addictive two businesses that just dont fail betting shops and cigarettes they even have a strong link,1
love the breakdown ive gradually built my finance and made my first 100k through investing which ive used to start my jewellery business and with what i’ve learned over a decade investing given enough time solid investments have the potential to double the initial principal amount but many investors are instead attracted to the lure of high yields in short periods of time despite the possibility of unattractive losses before even getting out so the onus is on newbies to beware having multiple income streams helped me stay afloat in business when the pandemic broke out,1
well explained i appreciate  i cant wait to get started because people are really making a lot of money from it nowadays,1
everybody is concerned about the market going down but refusing to take advantage of it the best decision i ever made in my life was investing in the crypto market trust me guys it really pays a lot ,1
successful people dont become that way overnight what most people see at a glancewealth a great career purposeis the result of hard work and hustle over time i pray that anyone who reads this will be successful in life,1
a business that solves problems will never go out of market this is the best takeaway thank you for that lovely conclusion at the end,1
i will forever be indebted to you you’ve changed my whole life i’ll continue to preach about your name for the world to hear you’ve saved me from a huge financial debt with just little investment thanks so much mrs annajn,1

you are a very smart salesman and entrepreneur iman much respect,1
youre a genius iman you supply us with the foundation for free so we as viewers know where to start thus know what to research but you also supply your own service with it all it is absolutely brilliant a fantastic ad if you will which shows how great of a marketer you truly are genius,1
the recent content feels better than ever before and the frequency of uploads is just perfect can see how much work is being put into this,1
the video is great especially when you talk about the agency business model although i disagree about some other business models generalizations for example on affiliate marketing nobody says you get paid once its an option theres revenue sharing pay per sale etc from dropshipping you can also get recurring with monthly kits or other types of products that have a smaller life cycle costumer the margins game is highly variable and thats where some people get ahead of others nevertheless selling roi services for businesses is still great for beginners but in the future it would be wise to get traffic in other ways while also building a brand for your agency website content and all,1
love the content and urge of openning peoples eyes to see where the future is heading to great work g,1
thank you iman for this awesome video you explain everything so clear i will analyze everything and watch more of your videos to try and start on my own and hopefully one day buy your course appreciate it man 3,1

isnt it just glorified fashion illustration essentially these are 3d drawings thats it actual fashion and the beauty of it is conquering your fashion sketches conquering your elaborate ideas by overcoming physical obstacles that is one of the main reason we love fashion to draw an haute couture dress is somewhat easy but to make it is beyond hard making a dress is a journey for all the people involved that is how innovation happens these animated pieces remind me the 80s licensing craze or something of sort it is a great new avenue for fashion houses to bank easy money it is not the future of fashion it is just a new market for fashion to expand silly gimmicks bringing big buck thats about it,1
i bought a large plot of land in the metaverse and i hope my kids can build and start families on it ,1
i don’t know y’all i really loved imvu the sims as a kid i literally found imvu because i was looking to play a dress up game 2nd life was a huge game at the time but it more for adults this is definitely going to take off the real question is how will be balance our “real” reality,1

love the breakdown i started my first business from money i made off dividends with what i’ve learned over a decade investing given enough time solid investments have the potential to double the initial principal amount but many investors are instead attracted to the lure of high yields in short periods of time despite the possibility of unattractive losses before even getting out so the onus is on newbies to beware having multiple income streams helped me stay afloat in business when the pandemic broke out,1
successful people dont become that way overnight what most people see at a glancewealth a great career purposeis the result of hard work and hustle over time i pray that anyone who reads this will be successful in life,1
this was so specific to me thanks,1
thats it i am starting my own websiteblog documenting the upcoming final year in my masters my thoughts and process of starting my own youtube channel and working on my masters thesis i will also try and get over my perfectionist mentality and just write something anything and improve as i continue on the journey thank for another great video ali,1
building wealth involves developing good habits like regularly putting money away in intervals for solid investments financial management is a crucial topic that most tend to shy away from and ends up haunting them in the near future putting our time and effort in activities and investments that will yield a profitable return in the future is what we should be aiming for success depends on the actions or steps you take to achieve it youre not going to remember those expensive shoes you bought ten years ago but you will remember every single morning when you look at your bank account that extra 0 in there i promise thats going to be way more fun to look at everyday,1
the ‘offer to work for free’ thing is surprisingly rare but great advice i took a gamble and emailed a company i covered in my psychology bsc to ask if i could come work for them for free and they gave me a paid gig as a trial 16 years later and i’m now managing director in all those years not one person has attempted the same thing,1
love this video as someone who is currently working in a generally gigbased industry im always looking ways to create some passive income that i can always fall back on and this was a very well thoughtout and informative video thanks ali,1
i’m starting a new business currently this is extremely helpful thank you ali,1

“the best way to measure your investing success is not by whether you’re beating the market but by whether you’ve put in place a financial plan and a behavioral discipline that are likely to get you where you want to go”,1
look man you folks have changed my life ive been struggling to make my design business profitable for almost a decade and because i couldnt figure it out myself ive been being employed by companies that dont serve me or my wallet ive been living short of my purpose and i knew it i have been watching this channel for 3 weeks and i have already started networking smarter charging more being more aggressive with my design style and approach i feel confident and you chris do have given me that as a creative i dont know if ill ever be able to thank yourepay you but know that you changed a mans life with what you know thank you so much and keep building the future,1
this was amazing thank you chris love the emphasis on value and that the buyer determines it i learned not to waste time trying to convince someone to see value you can help them realize the value but you can’t force them to change what they value that’s a losing game,1
so glad this made it to chris desired metric im only 15 minutes in and have received massive value from this thank you so much chris i am still in the beginning stages of getting my photovideo portfolio ready but this massively changes how i think about pricing and will be extremely beneficial when i start to take on paid work,1
this guy is one of the best business teachers ive ever studied with on youtube,1
every family has a person who breaks the chain of poverty i hope you will be that person,1
i watch elon musk videos to grow back the neurons i lost throughout the day looking at memes,1
for sure the reality business is hard and painful and takes a huge amount of effort if you want to build something great the best quote i heard was nobody is expecting you to do something amazing but it is amazing when you do something the reality is you might not build a multi billion dollar business that is global but you might build something that brings value and that is why we get into business to test ourselves our own ability and to be different you can only admire what elon musk has achieved and the potential of where technology could take us in the future,1
i already lost a lot of money recently trying to pursuit my dreams its frustrating and depressing but elon definitely gives me hope and determination he is a role model for me,1
great video but let me talk about something important i see many young and old make mistakes that i think should not be i believe that everyone young or old should have an investment plan that increases their financial returns from three figures to six figures the investment can be your retirement plan or future plan depending on what you want but what matters most is that you have an investment that is profitable,1
if your customers love you your odds of success are dramatically higher great stuff,1
at 224 elon says something quite profound entrepreneurs are born of everyday this resonates with me because the next big entrepreneurs are likely to be ordinary people with an innovative idea and a solution to a problem that people face everyday they are problem solvers its quite exciting to see fresh new ideas come to market and people starting new businesses,1

i’m impressed with max the dude is super smart and running this like a high performing tech startup best coffee shop interview yet,1
i was losing my confidence in thinking my dream of opening up a local coffee shop would be impossible but this story was so inspiring mooney is so damn down to earth its really cool to see the success of just the love and passion into it,1
wow amazing maxwell just gave away the secret to running a successful business i own and operate my own company and 95 of what he said is something you cant learn from school honestly well done,1
first met max back when he was still operating out of the coffee stall hes a great entrepreneur and skilled coffee shop owner,1
maxvell is such a great person hes very generous with his knowledge and experience and thats sadly hard to find nowadays hes also extremely capable business owner with amazing systems implemented in the business,1
as a business owner and video enthusiast i love your channel the details you get about business operations are fantastic your video production has continued to improve and is amazing the lighting transitions pacing camera motion and audio are absolutely top level and this video took lighting to a new level can you add the camera video production gear you use to your resources section of the description thanks very much for the great content,1
maxwell is an incredible guy i love how deep he dove into understanding not just coffee but the processes and most importantly customer experience what an inspiration,1
felt like this was a tech startup more than a coffee shop this guy is so well organized and passionate about his business,1
i love this interview ive been dreaming of opening a coffee shop in my neighborhood over the last 2 years we moved to a brand new neighborhood without much comercial options within 4 miles i keep telling people i know i dream of this and the associate pastor at my church said i should pitch them putting up a pop up stand in the church i was amazed that they trust me enough to do that but at the same time im scared to start even though i have a lot of support at church and friends one of my friends owns a coffee shop already on the other side of town and is willing to get me in front of the right people but again my family is relying on my income to live i know it would be great i just need to find a person i trust to help run it along side with me so i can maintain my insurance career at the same time since its not demanding at all,1

as you can see we are already in august and i feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just naïve the sphere have seen far worse times than this enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions id say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than holding trading went smooth for me as i was able to raise over 92 btc when i started at 35 btc in just few weeks implementing trades with signals and insights from liberton corp would advise y’all to trade your asset rather than hold for a future you arent sure about,1
keep up the great work you are truly an asset to the community thanks for all you do i like your truthful coverage btcs price has been fluctuating lately buying isnt a tough call but it is a very tough call to figure out what to do aside holding the good thing about the space is that you can buy the dips and put them into active trades while confidently waiting for a pump in price because it is inevitable most people do not understand how the space works your advantage in understanding chart wont guarantee what an asset is going to do prices will go up or down nevertheless the market has been so profitable despite price ups and down ive always played safe implementing trades with insights and signals from a renowned trader libertoncorp i made 12btc from this recent crash and despite the ups and down in the market i’m still bagging more money,1
a shoutout to the true american patriots,1
love you bor ,1
okay sir thank sagar rana ji,1
imran interviews the most powerful individuals in the fashion industry but i truly believe he holds just as much influence this series is exactly what the industry needs in terms of consumers listening and fellow designersindustry professionals taking note imran is the projector of those poignant words and as a collective it holds much greater power,1
luxury fashion is one of the worlds biggest industries i think this is a great topic for a bloomberg series i would be interested is seeing more of this type of content i am particularly interested in the recent collaboration between gucci and balenciaga especially now that i know they both come under the kering umbrella other recent collaborations include versace and fendi which could be the subject of another video the more recent video in this series examines the chinese market and how fashion brands are now targeting young asian consumers,1
i love the new sustainability efforts excited to see new changes,1
i switched years ago from fashion to reupholstery so glad i get to reduce reuse upcycle last of a dying breed 2 of the world do what we still do,1
as a fellow asian i can confidently say that the rarest thing in this video was kyles beautiful stache,1
back in 2017 i caught a 40pound king upriver along the klutina river feeder river to the copper river and it was one of the best days of my life that was a ‘reel’ workout,1
i always enjoyed selling this product as a fishmonger it was something my guest looked forward to and i was happy to sell it rly is top tier fish and some i do quite respect,1
so glad kyle brought up how important salmon are for native alaskan communities,1
wish kyle and his crew all the luck to always bring home king salmon every time they go out to fish for it,1
i was lucky to have copper river salmon once it was by far the best salmon i’ve ever tasted,1
im really glad he acknowledged the indigenous traditions and food culture there are a lot of fishermen that dont care about preservation or morals,1
its fascinating that a gill netted fish in an estuary not at the peak of their growth cycle garners so much money when compared to troll caught kings on hook and line when theyre still putting on fat that are treated immediately to ike jima processed individually and then hand packed on ice to get core temps down immediately,1
i am happy for this dude he seem happy and humble i wish him nothing but luck,1

nothing brings me more satisfaction than efficiency to think about how all that merchandise is going to be resold and not go into a landfill makes me very happy indeed,1
i have yet to make a return to amazon that wasn’t damaged double shipped or not as described they could avoid a lot of returns by better vetting i also often select returned items if the saving are worth it so far no problems,1
this is one of the coolest things ive noticed recently when ollies popped up in my hometown selling namebrand goods at a quarter of the original pricei knew liquidation stores would be the way of the future i love it it makes me happy seeing these goods find homes instead of ending up as pollution,1
as a person who shops on the clearance aisles at stores im loving this documentary its an industry not many people think of on a large scale but definitely very profitable,1
the only issue is that the majority of customers are resellers so most consumers aren’t getting the discount but either way it helps the environment which is great,1
i love how the newer music artists are paying homage to the old school beats it gives it a different feel but latto she doing her ish,1
they did a damn good job with this sample beat goes crazyyyyy,1
they did a damn good job with this sample beat goes crazyyyyy,1
the young queen latto delivers every time props to the artist but she’s going to make it sell capricorn energy all day my kids kids gone have they way on godgenerational wealth health wisdom overflow,1
i loved this the flow of lakeyah is satisfying ,1
latto and lakeyah have such complimentary flows and deliveries they are both great in their own ways too but hearing them work together is always a treat i think the fanbases are generally really similar too which is nice to see likeminded people collide every time they collab i hope someday i can gather even a tenth of the amount of fans with the perspectives that theses two fan bases have for my own music truly unmatched energy,1
respect to lakeyah fr she is truly flourishing and big latto killed her verse per usual 3,1
the first thing i want you to knowwhom ever you might be is that god loves you i dont care what you have done in the past i dont care of the mistakes you have made the blunders we all have he loves you i want you to understand that millions have prayed this prayer around the world and now it is your turn in just a few moments time if you believe it is all god requires believe it forget about your past when they put jesus in that tomb they put all of your sins in that tomb as well when jesus walked out of that tomb he walked out victorious and we came out with him a new creation in christ jesus i am going to pray and i want you to pray with me i am going to say the words that you need to say saying words cannot save you but if you truly believe in your heart you will be saved and i want you to say them out loud and mean them with all of your heart and jesus christ will come into your heart and change your heart and change your life let us pray dear god in heaven i come to you i am sorry for my sins and the way i have lived the things i have done please forgive me cleanse me with your precious blood from every sin i have ever committed right now with my mouth i confess the lord jesus and in my heart i believe that jesus died for me and rose from the dead and i accept jesus christ this very moment as my savior my redeemer and i make him the lord of my life and right now i am a new creation i am washed i am cleansed i am saved we ask this all in the name of jesus amen,1
their flow on this production is ,1
killed it  the beat so hard ,1
this is an amazing story most times it amazes me greatly how i moved from an average lifestyle to earning over 63k per month utter shock is the word i have understood a lot in the past few years to doubt that opportunities are bound in the financial markets the only thing is to know where to focus,1
i think this is very inspiring and a big shoutout to anyone who is brave enough to follow their dreams and pursue a career or lifestyle that isnt the norm ,1
man finance channels really are the way to go cries in travel nah just kidding nothing beats a vacation wheels up kudos to her her fans seem to be getting valuable info,1
investing is so important in life so important i cant explain enough the importance of starting early and keeping the course love the video and i hope you make more videos on investing in the future,1
building wealth involves developing good habits like regularly putting money away in intervals for solid investments financial management is a crucial topic that most tend to shy away from and ends up haunting them in the near future putting our time and effort in activities and investments that will yield a profitable return in the future is what we should be aiming for success depends on the actions or steps you take to achieve it youre not going to remember those expensive shoes you bought ten years ago but you will remember every single morning when you look at your bank account that extra 0 in there i promise thats going to be way more fun to look at everyday i pray that anyone who reads this will be successful in life,1
everyone should become a finance guru no one will be poor,1

small business be like a pretty box pretty filling with an extra and amazon be like here’s a brown box take it or leave it,1
packing a fake order till i get a real one that hit so hard i really hope she gets orders and her business blooms 3,1
it’s so inspiring to new entrepreneurs to see others also starting their own businesses good luck to anyone who’s opening their first business,1
the detail and thoughtfulness some of these people put into their packaging is just insane obviously whether the product itself is actually good is another matter but just the sheer creativity beauty and detail in the presentation would probably make me wanna order from them again even if the product itself wasnt anything super special that kind of packaging makes receiving the product an experience like getting an incredible delightful present i would be smiling like crazy and squealing with delight as soon as i open a box like that would probably make my whole week these people are so cool and i admire and respect them so much,1
just gonna add some positivity in the comment section by saying i’m so proud of of these people with their small business im personally too afraid to start my own business not yet at least but these people just straight up sent it with whatever they got lol i genuinely wish all of them to do well ,1
i’m 12 as well and i was inspired to start my own business by these tiktoks i started painting custom ordered seashells i’m so happy with how my business turned out d all i did to figure out what i was going to sell is i went around my room five times with my eyes closed and what ever my finger landed on i sold and it landed on a seashell and that’s how my business started i would really recommend starting your own business as a past time it’s also a great way to earn money and allowance as a kid and it’s so fun to do i really enjoy it it can be stressful at times but it’s so worth it d,1
extremely helpful great overall video thank you i even love how your matched with some of the colors on the slide very coordinated just subscribed and will probably be binge watching your videos for the rest of the day i know the effort that it takes to produce these tutorials so much appreciated,1
im overwhelmed when trying to learn how to use canva by myself because therere tons of functions thank you for making this video using canva is much easỉer now,1
wow  just finished your tutorial it took me somewhere between three and four hours to go through it because i stopped it all the time to try out almost everything you had just presented in order to remember things better and while doing so actually discovered a few more things i also appreciated some of your design ideas which further opened my eyes to the endless possibilities canva offers i had already watched a number of other tutorials some also very well presented but most are way too short they just awaken your curiosity but then leave you hanging there struggling after having worked through your tutorial i feel that i hit the ground running and am now off to your other tutorials to learn more having come down with covid fortunately not too bad i still have a few more days of quarantene left that i will use for studying and practising more ,1
this is a great video great tips like the alt shortcuts etc besides all the clear explanations for each feature love the updated thread as well keep up the good work thanks for filling the 15 hours with very useful information delivering with such speed as well is commendable fantastic effort kudos to you,1
wow it’s like i’m actually in a class very informative and presented at a digestible pace thank you so much worth watching multiple times so everything sinks in,1
this was the first tutorial i watched when i started my canva journey so comprehensive thank you natalia,1
natalie you angel thank you so much unknowingly youve helped me create my first piece a very special memorial card for my mumma  not long into your beautifully explained tutorial i had canva open and found it so easy to do what i was stressing about starting for so long again thank you lovely lady ,1
i cannot thank you enough for this tutorial really clear explanations and examples i have been using canva pro for about a month and love it but this video has blown my mind  it will take some time to learn about the many different aspects of canva and i will be referring back to this video often subscribed and looking forward to watching more of your tutorials ,1

can we all just give this man a round of applause for putting this information out here for free great video man thank you so much for this course i will study it all,1
by far the best excel tutorial i have seen for beginners complete basic to the point and very useful in real life situations great course thank you shad sluiter for sharing,1
your explanations are simple and fluid you have deconstructed all the difficulty myths related to learning excel hats off and thank you,1
thank you so much for this i had an easy time following the pace of the course also the examples and exercises were great with 3060 minutes per day i could complete the course in 5 days good stuff,1
most logical and very easytounderstand course content his way of explaining is incomparable to anyone in his profession and the topic is covered vividly and never feels bored i gained so strong knowledge immensely in a tiny time hat off to the professor youre the great teacher to me i ever had in this field sir best wishes for your future tutorials and life as well,1
excellent practical course for someone who knows only the very minimal basics if that well modulated and articulated designed for adult self learners easy to follow and it is a plus that you did not use techie language your presentation style made it easy to follow without distractions real life examples are a plus application of knowledge always enhances learning looking forward to your next course,1
im about 30 minutes in and i gotta admit you are brilliant at organizing what you want to teach youve managed to organize even zooming in and out at specific intervals to teach all those small aspects of the program really cool i never knew excel was so intuitive either,1
this was an excellent class well done in organization methods and process there are lots of tools out there but this class is better because problems are solved as examples are worked out in this way it keeps your attention while deepening the learning,1
one hour into this video and i have learned more about how to use apis and postman than i have with tons of other videos combined i cant see how video instruction can get better than this all the money i have spent to learn this and actually understand it and this video instructor provides the most precise explanation i have seen to date excellent work,1
there is so much thought process and hard work put in by the content creators we need this kind of content more so that students feel more confident learning newer things i have become a huge fan of the channelhats off to you guys keep doing this great work,1
here i am employed as a developer watching a video that purports to be for beginners and its a great video so far one of the things i love about approaches like this is that especially for developers like me who just picked up some crap over time and am doing stuff with it there are lots of fundamentals that slip through those autodidactic cracks for instance i know what statelessness means generally but then at around 2330 craig explains not only clearly but completely enough for the contextwith no extraneous details nice work,1
you guys make learning fun the fact that you went over apis in a broad sense and not just webbased really nailed home what an api really is wow,1
im enjoying your tutorial a lot but a side note i think its recommended to invoke pip as python m pip because it is more portable having recently had issues due to windows10 and trying naively to just invoke pip on its own i thought it would be worth mentioning especially since this is aimed at beginners who might struggle with issues like that cheers,1
this was truly a whirlwind introduction to apis i believe it was a little more harder for me as i havent started to learn java yet still learning python but none less this is an extremely well done course thank you craig for your work and i will now take another rest as ive reached the end to unscramble my brain,1
this is easily the best course in this section hats of to this guy didnt feel like boring bombarment of information enjoyed every moment of it,1
such an approachable manner of teaching craig thank you even as a refresher for me i just felt compelled to keep listening through am sure this has been extremely useful for introducing newcomers into coding no end,1
i havent finished yet but wonderful explanations and great examples so far with teachers like this learning is a joy,1
i have gone through this course from the beginning to end it was a wonderful tutorial and now i could write basic sequel queries with confident i was having very less knowledge about and was not confident in writing queries before thank you mosh and keep up the good work,1
the tutorials are truly simple to understand and taught in a very beginnerfriendly way thank you mosh i love your channel,1

what a gorgeous look thank you for always giving us tips btw i saw another youtuber who compared the amount of the ct bronzer to other bronzers in her collection and the ct had a lot less product in comparison i guess the packaging is deceiving not talking about the how good the product is just talking about the amount,1

i just want to say that in my job i write sql coding every day and i’m branching out now learning c just as a hobby currently and this video is seriously one of the best instruction videos mike is awesome i wish he had a followup for teaching advanced c i just love his way of teaching it’s excellent precise not overly wordy and simple and the best thing is he runs his query after every example so we can clearly see the output seriously he is the best great speaker and presenter edit just a note but mike even explained loops which also occur in sql and it’s something i honestly haven’t ever really fully grasped before but because of this video i finally get it this actually is going to positively effect my job too not just my hobby just wonderful teaching,1
great tutorial its hard to find someone who explains the basics as well as touching on more commonly used variables also thank you for leaving in your mistakes it helps knowing that experienced programmers still miss common mistakes,1
i needed to learn something about c in a hurry my first thought was to seek you out again as expected you were clear and concise and made it all so easy you are a superstar,1
this was one of the few programming videos which i completed fully thanks to mike for explaining each and every concept crisp and clear eagerly excited to start my journey in programming,1
you taught me more in 4 hours than my professor did in an entire semester,1
dude i dont know if you know but this tutorial is one of the cleanest concise on youtube the way you get to the point and explain well in brief manner makes learning c seem intuitive i know this is just the surface but it is presented in a way that makes it feel breezy and effortless,1
i love how he teaches multiple coding languages the same it makes learning them a lot easier and quicker to understand,1
this is awesome this is how a tutorial should be i did not think i could have finished it all the way and right now im already on 35 if i can really make some good use of coding i will surely join id love to watch more of your tut,1
i’ve done some sql database management in a gui before but learning to do it through a terminal has been awesome i would love to see a part two going over primary and foreign keys and database relationships the way you format your videos is great for learning and i love it thank you so much for the content you put out here’s hoping for a part 2,1
i learned more from this video than i did from an entire semester of a watching paint dry intro to databases class thanks chuck,1
yes please chuck make more videos about sql you read my mind i just started to make a website with flask for python and a sqlite3 or mysql database thanks for the new video,1
1948 i understand that this is for beginners just starting with sql but in my opinion you should always delete with unique value like id in this case because later youll probably have more than one jeff keep up the good work,1
just wanted to add that having strong knowledge of sql and databases in general is extremely helpful for developing queries and detection rules using tools like splunk spl or defender kql great video please get in the weeds,1
i was just thinking the other day that i really need to start learning sql beyond just using it blindly in applications great timing and really great intro for me looking forward to the next one,1
thank you sir this reminds me of a lesson i didnt understand in class but you made me understand about sql in just 24 minutes with enjoyable explanation ,1
that was extremely helpful wish they wouldve shown that in school when we were learning about databases and mysql,1
love how hayes reviewed swtor saw the terrible tutorial then made a whole video breaking down an effective tutorial,1
i love how having grown up with games im just taking these systems for granted and remember being annoyed with some and instantly engaged by others without knowing why either i have just been ignoring the obvious to not ruin the illusion or well im just not very good at reflecting over my hobby xd at any rate thanks for a very informative upload hail the shadow cabal,1
john romero used to say that the first level in the game was the last level he designed by that time you already know what the whole game is going to play like and you can use that knowledge to weave it all together seamlessly it works perfectly for somewhat simple games like commander keen and doom and id like to think that it still works for more advanced or narrativedriven games thoughts,1
just the sight of a portal test chamber brings me joy,1
its amazing to me that guild wars 1 had such an incredible tutorial island so much so that people spent years min maxing and living in it as a main point of playing said game and never leaving it for the pure enjoyment of it,1
while it is a good idea to seamlessly blend tutorial and initial gameplay i still have a soft spot for stuff like the hazard course in halflife which is an inuniverse training grounds for people to get familiar with the hev suit and in turn the game and its mechanics,1
honestly i feel like the most important option with a tutorial is the option to skip it entirely for replaying purposes and the option to revisit it at any point in the game,1
hey everyone wanted to make a video that we could easily teach you lightroom and get you going or refer to from time to time as a quick refresher love you guys a ton and i honestly hope this helps anyone everyone out there looking to get better at editing photos i cant wait to see what you guys can do after this feel free to leave any future videos you want to see in the comments and ill add em to the list have a great sunday sawyer,1
honestly that was one of the most understandable intuitive tutorial videos i have ever seen many thanks,1
ive never really felt comfortable in knowing what i was doing with the tone curve but this video totally nails it great tutorial so easy to follow thank you,1
i love how this is not a ill show you the tools but take my private course to really learn something kind of video and i love how you encourage people to learn with differents tools and its not like you do this and that and all done,1
hi sawyer thank you so much for doing this video im six months into my photography business and finally tackling lightroom it seemed super complicated at first but you truly helped me get over the fear of jumping in,1
i could cry i never make it through a full tutorial but you have made is so easy and fun to learn thank you so much for this video,1
this guy explained it exactly how it needs to be explained most people try to do tutorials that seem like they are for professionals but why would a professional be watching it great tutorial,1
i wish i had watched this earlier before i watched all other work flow tutorials this is not only a work flow tutorial but also a fundamental guidemanual of the software and explains what works how i understand lightroom much much better now and im excited to apply all of these to my next photo editing thank you so much best lightroom basic tutorial ever,1
this tutorial is amazing straight to the point and great energy thank you so much sawyer,1
hands down one of the best explanations of basic photo editing in lightroom i have ever seen simple to the point enlightening especially what to do where and why it helps you leave the basic tab more often and with confidence i have seen many tutorials but watching this turned on new light switches of understanding thanks,1

i know everyone jokes about seasoning and gordon ramsay but i just love how passionate he is with cooking,1
i was able to make a perfect burger for the first time in my life by following your recipe and processes thank you,1
gordons solo cooking shows are awesome his videos look kind of complicated but theyre really pretty straightforward and common ingredients i feel dumb for never using a neutral oil grapeseed while grilling a burger that with the seasoning steps makes all the difference,1
gordon ramsay is a wonderful person a master of his craft,1
he explained all the stuff in one hour which my school been explaining since 4 months respect sir,1
i am a totally layman but i finished watching this one hour course so interesting what a great teacher his teaching can even attract a person like me who just wish to know some basics of web development great job thanks mosh,1
im a student software developer at vocational school and ive learned more in this video than ive learned at school since september great video,1
i cannot begin to thank you enough for this video so many resources teach the syntax but dont take you through actually applying it i loved that not only did you explain the various elements of html and css but you demonstrated it in a fun engaging and easy to understand way that viewers can follow along with i really enjoyed following step by step this is definitely one of those things you learn by doing not just watching ive been playing around with visual studio code all day creating my own little mock websites for fun thank you so much mosh,1
seeing such a smooth colorful and professional tutorial i guess anyone would fall in love with coding mosh youre the best in creating courses ,1
i can’t believe i learned this in less than a day if i knew you long time ago i would have been a guru by now always scared of coding now you made me love it you are so great thanks a million,1
i am a novice who’s transitioning into frontend web development and this is the best tutorial i’ve seen well detailed using easy grammar and great explanatory videos thank you so much for this you make it so easy,1
thank you mosh this was a refresher for me as always your tutorials are so friendly and easy to follow along with,1
the fact that i watched all the makeup tutorial without getting bored is unbelievable i love how she’s so natural and simple her accent is so beautiful she reminds me of a disney character’s love you and keep on,1
she make it looks so easy fast and natural even on smoke colors it looks smooth  love it,1
i love how she literally explains everything step by step she’s so cute ,1
girl you’re rocking more and more every day soooo beautiful,1
i come from a radiovoiceover background her voice matches exactly how she looks absolutely adorable i find her style of delivery to be quite soothing she should do voiceovers for makeup commercials i could listen to her all day,1
this is amazing you are so confident and it makes the whole video look better just a tip if you wet a qtip just a little bit you can get any mascara or eyeliner smudges off super easily,1
i loved this every single product you use and your applications are flawless definitely watching more of your content,1
i’d wear this look everyday i love all your videos ,1
the whole look is gorgeous but the eyes are beautiful,1
me picking out my morning eye crust brad”i’m sure you look incredible”,1
i love how brad actually understand what an inch is in meanings of hair 6 months ago i had my hair down to my waist and asked to get 3 inches off my hair he cut off 8 inches and it looked absolutely horrendous i asked for layers and he gave me the choppiest hair you will ever see i cried for 2 days straight and went to school in a ponytail for 2 months,1
hi brad im the girl from the first video i actually ended up getting rid of the colour because it started coming out its now red thank you so much for watching edit for a bit of context this is the account that i watch videos and comment on my main is the one that i post on so please can you stop harassing me,1
brad i dont know what you look like but im sure you look incredible me laying in bed at 3am with dorito dust on my face and hair unbrushed thanks brad,1
i’m really proud of the way that she took notes literally her hair looks adorable on her this is a great style for her the color is really pretty for her complexion even though she may need to do it one more time to hit all those spots,1
my toxic trait is watching these and immediately saying “yes i must try this now” it turned out great i think wavy hair is so forgiving every time i cut it myself hehe,1
i just did my daughters hair and omg we are both loving it she has curly hair from being biracial and it works so well for her why didnt we do this earlier,1
brads wolf haircut tute was super helpful i havent cut my hair myself in years but i was tired of telling stylists i wanted tons of layers and only getting them at the bottom of my hair so i said fuck it watched his tutorial and went in on my hair with my good shears and thinning scissors best haircut ive had in years so thanks brand mondo,1
i am a retired hairstylist and your videos are very entertaining i did that same haircut back in the 80s on myself and others it was not called the wolf cut but was called the farah worn by the actress farah fawcett from the show charlies angels i see here it has made a comeback,1
rip to the great legend technoblade,1
definetely use the honey block under villager trick its incredibly helpful also i dont know if you can do this but also try doing it with mobs might be helpful when your capturing mobs for something or someone,1
its cool that both editions have there own features to themselves java with timed combat slab crouching and crawling and bedrock with crossplay potion cauldron armor stand arms and some other stuff that i forgot,1
i found a really fancy simple and inexpensive chair design you put down a slab on the ground a door on the back trap doors on the sides and of all things a sign post above the slab on the door now this works best with two different wood types but it still looks really cool warped for the sign and slab look best for me also does anyone else see spiders in the black and red tericota or nemo fish in the blue orange taracota might be a story telling ability there might be fun to explore,1
the darker wood underwater technique also works well for showing stepped on vs unused stairs for instance and for paths across rock substitute cobble and gravel to show the wear,1
not gonna lie gordon ramsay seems like a nice guy teaching us peasants how to cook,1
i love how he teaches the right timing to turn the food i usually end up burning it because im afraid of undercooking so its great to get these pro tips,1
i had no idea you had this channel and are making videos teaching all of us for free that’s awesome thank you very much mr ramsay,1
im watching this while im sad and honestly hes kinda wholesome i feel like if he was teaching his kids how to cook he would teach them in this manner probably in more advanced recipes since this would be pretty basic to him hes just a dude thats highly passionate about cooking,1
even after all these years hes the most enjoyable chef to watch,1
i enjoyed this lesson very much ive taught music for 37 years and i recognize good teaching loved that you told people to take their time this nurturing technique makes me want to cook and learn new recipes thank you for sharing your immense knowledge,1
ive learned so much from these videos i wasnt a bad cook before but learning a few tricks in slicing things more effectively has made me actually enjoy cooking,1
thank you chef ramsay for sharing your talents with me this has helped me to be better in the kitchen blessings to you and your family,1
what i love about gordon is he shares everything he learned a lot of chefs keep their secrets but he teaches i love it i have cooked almost everything gordon has shown i want to personally thank you bc of you my wife loves me more,1

this is one of the most prettiest looks you’ve ever done embrace the lips the skin the eyes your natural beauty,1
it gives a early 2000’s vibe but like an upgrade version i’m here for it for me i do dabble in some cool tone eyeshadows myself but this look is everything specially the lips like it really just pulls the look together i wished i was blessed with the pigment on your lips  either way you look so flawless as always and girl your skin without makeup is so perfect,1

her skin is unbelievable not just in this video but over the years every picture of her i notice her skin she seems very sweet too,1

i love that she used her own products but didnt talk about it for 10 mins and just introduced them like all of the other products that she used i love her so much what a queen,1

hey just wanna let you know i used your tutorials to learn and now 4 weeks later i can almost perfectly juggle about 1015 times still a long way to go but really amazing tutorials and it was a lot of fun the journey thanks a lot,1

hey taylor it’s been a while since i watched this video i was talking to joe dinoto and he said i should let you know that you are the reason i can juggle today your explanations are great and it was something i always thought were just beyond my ability so thank you and please keep up the amazing work,1
i really like the way you teach got my juggling balls now i’m going to start practicing by the way i am 66 years old and i want to do this to keep my brain working well,1
thank you really much a great thing to learn during lockdown times,1
thanks really clear instructions with great does and donts im finally learning to actually juggle at 67 years old,1

the education edition is also a part of the pocket and bedrock edition this means that mobile bedrock players can play education edition without paying more than what minecraft actually costs it is a world setting i love it ,1
the feature i love most about education edition is the chalkboards they are so much easier to type on give you more room to type and you can go back and edit them,1
mannn i really wish theyd bring some of these awesome items over to the java edition colored torches and sparklers balloons plus there are pocket edition items i wish theyd bring over too,1
back when i used pocket edition i used a lot of these glad to know they’re being recognized,1
glad to see education is getting some attention sure it’s the version made for learning but it has probably some of the best map making features out of all minecraft versions,1
i used to play mcee in school all the time before the pandemic even though my teacher probably hated me and all the kids that played games during class i couldnt help but notice all the anazing things in this version of minecraft i basically forgot all about it until i watched this video it was basically free as its obtainable to anyone with a school laptop the laptops were on a lan so wed be able to join other players worlds like parkour hungergames or minigames,1
i actually think that blaze rods could be used with glow ink sacs to make glow sticks if javabedrock were to have them,1
ed edition is so good its just sad that it doesnt get much recognition online also the agent can be used as a portable inventory by spawning it placing the items in its inventory and then you can despawn it or just leave it then resummon it later,1
she has to be one of the prettiest people to walk this earth,1
i aspire to give off her energy she’s confident and sure while also being calm and genuine i literally desire to be her essence,1
“i’m still blending because i don’t want my mom to yell at me”  i love her,1
you can tell how close she must be to her mum she mentions her every 2 minutes its so adorable,1
she looks so pretty without makeup ,1
she has that voice which we have in our head when we talk to ourselves 247,1
not to shade anyone but being latina im glad to have some representation in the form of alexa maybe because i really admire her but i can relate more with her in the sense shes not the typical latina bombshell shes still a bombshell and one of the most sensual and confident women ive seen and i really like how shes connected to her feminity love her authenticity as well,1
i needed these i literally love their hair and how voluminous it is school starts soon for me and i literally want mine to look like paislees it’s probably my favourite she’s gorgeous and so are all the other girls love from canada xx,1

that glass panebeacon thing was neat i liked that though i find beacon beams kind of unsightly in general i kind of wish you could have the boosted effect without the beam i know vanilla tweaks has a resource to have them be invisible to me but that doesnt mean everyone isnt seeming my base just surrounded in beams maybe they could make tinted glass function as a beam nullifier while still maintaining effects thatd be nice,1
this was an incredible video i didnt know about glass instead of dead coral fan or mud for sugar cane thank you so much,1
i started using mud for sugar cane purely for aesthetics didnt realize it had other uses for sugar cane farms,1

thanks for the update and keep doing what you do my journey in the current market has taught me a lot of lessons at the top of that list is that it never pays to live above ones means i have managed to grow a nest egg of around 600k to a decent 7 figures in the space of a few months sad to say but a lot of us have poor money management skills my 2 cents get an advisor to keep you accountable and aid you make better decisions carolyn halles has been helping me a lot all through my journey i find it better to pay a little bit more for peace of mind than worry about money or market trends and still get burned,1

great video again marko you did a great job  sadly the netherlands was not in your list as a viewer or replied on your videos  in addition i can tell that after the fukushima nuclear incident in march 2011 the eu banned nuclear power plants due to risk of a second chernobyl incident the thru regulations coal was stamped as dirty and gas was the second best option after nuclear power if we go back into history the north european countries the netherlands also build the infrastructure for gas pipes in cities and villages since there wasnt a need to change and gas was promoted after 2011 the perfect storm was created now there is need so the coal and nuclear power plants are being restarted to for fill the energy need from my point of view these things should change nuclear is the way to go create a military security perimeter around nuclear power plants the western world shouldnt be working with russia nor china for energy or any productions due to the believe differences and reliability furthermore the ecb cant loosen any monetary policy because there is nothing to stimulate with 0 intrest rates the financial unstable countries you call them pigs portugal italy greece spain and with this structural inflation problems russia knows this and the ecb messed up big time last but not least the eu but also the usa canada australia and japan need to stop applying qe start paying debts and slowly deflate for the upcoming 5 to 10 years if not this system will implode and nothing will be affordable thanks again marko,1

as the economic crisis keep rising one needs to have different streams of income a well detailed diversified investment portfolio in the financial markets is needed to survive as well as secure a profitable investment future thanks to mrs sophia johnny for improving my portfolio,1
when it comes to investing diversification is key that’s why i engage in sectors based on projected growth there’s no shortcut to getting rich but there are smart ways to go about it,1
this is so well done especially by someone who is a ceo and took time out to do this thank you,1

i am 57 which is old for a crypto investor i fomod in heavily in 2019 didnt have a clue made many stupid mistakes but was lucky and still made nice gains i kept 25 btc 5 eth in my bag and would have enough to quadruple that amount on a decent drop i recently decided alice marcella take on the market makes sense so im following her lead will i be upset if she is wrong and i totally missed the bottom absolutely not because she actually made a lot of profit for me and i’m still trading with her till date i would advise yall to trade your asset rather than hodl for a future you arent sure about,1
im glad i got into crypto when i did because it’s been a turning point for me financiallybeen my best decision so far,1
when you have high interest rates environment its logical to buy consumer staples and not discretionary because people consumers will buy what they need certain products wont be affected much especially if they are highly priced which means that they are for high earners this is especially important for a company called apple important to know product pricing and the consumer,1
how away from work but still earning good cash all with the help of mr richard friedman trading with you is an awesome experience in the stock market and cryptocurrency as well,1
great insight man trying to make sense of the crypto market structure can be pretty daunting for a complete noob investor regardless of the market disposition whats most attractive is the possibility of making portfolio changing returns i was opportune to meet stacy huth and her exceptional knowledge of the market saved me from inherent losses and have so far earned me over 14 btc in the last quarter what a time to be alive indeed,1
burned,1
my portfolio is always growing be fearless when others are scared warren buffet famously stated longterm investments should be made and patience is a virtue because the stock market always rebounds,1
owning quality dividend stocks are the best dividends are higher,1
it has been awesome really crypto is very frustrating i was astonish how i made 71380 with 14k as a novice i got to put in some in it tho,1
the only good thing is that powell seems to be more level minded than predaccesors and it looks like he will raise interest rates aggressively based on his discussions he seems determined to get inflation under control irrespective of falling asset values he might just be the knight in shining armour who comes to the rescue just at the right time although he messed up with inflation peaking he is the only one who makes sense at the fed,1
at the end he speaks about youth unemployment as the precepts of generational poverty he is correct that is why mayor marion barry youth summer jobs program was so transformative work builds ethics confidence and saves you from wasted idle time like scrolling tiktok all summer,1
after losing so much to stock market one best investment decision i ever made afterwards was investing in financial markets which has earned me 34970 profit every 14days lately trust me guys it pays a lot,1
i firmly believe the markets will either go up or down i will not charge you for this sound advice you’re welcome,1

to reach your potential you need to start doing investing remains the smartest way to prepare for the unexpected been in the space for 7yrs and extremely pleased with the decision i made the good news is — it’s not too late,1
learning from the professionals thank you,1
this introduction for corporate finances is for me i loved the explanation of the business life cycle in the market i like the advisory side of explanations my god this is great sound video to see on you tube i am looking the text book to review this things so i can understand it correctly correct video and accurate explanations nice one mr uploader keep on uploading this things i just love to see how other professors are explaing some of this things about cf nice one,1
i took the course and ive completed 3 out 7 in my bundle i really recommend this to anyone is looking to review or really tap into valuations and corporate finance methods and terminology if i were an investment bank i would encourage everyone in the team to take this course,1
great content explained in simplicity thank you for a job well done,1
nice one sir god blessed for your great explanationsi really need to know more about this class can you talk about the analis and horozontal vertical percentage i want to know more about them even the ratio i want to know more about them even equity these things are important to mesir can you upload tableau and explained how we should use it i have downloaded it but i dont really know how to work on it i need good explanations on it difficult class from the begining of the class thanks so much sir for your great explanations the course is a requirement in most university aslong as you are in the business field you will need to do it i know some students are taking it a lot great explanations sir,1

hi guys thanks a lot for your lessons as a young man from africa having great passion and interest in finance i would really appreciate you being my mentor tim vipong,1
thanks a lot for these clear explanations i am keen to master all that stuff more indeph,1
great content in your channel i’m 53 and my wife and i reached 1m net worth in 2017 five years later it’s 24m our yearly salary is a little over 100k we drive older cars cook at home eat leftovers and have 2 in college we saved for college and our boys help by working they will graduate debt free,1
freeing your mind from consumerism is so important were literally trained from young to always want more to never be satisfied to compare ourselves to our neighbors and what they have i was always a natural saver but struggled a bit in not comparing myself to others its still something i work on but over time have gotten better it definitely helped that i realized the image others put forward the majority of the time is financed by debt thats not something im interested in at all i hope more people learn this concept and actively practice it ill definitely talk about it on my channel as well,1
retiring early is possible but tough it definitely requires discipline and big sacrifices it’s not only about saving the huge step is boosting earning capacity the stock market and real estate are by far the most profitable my portfolio has experienced,1
i think what brings more happiness is to work for a purpose that makes us feel bigger than our need for survival a sense of belonging to something greater than ourselves instead of working for money,1
the finance minister of tn is more intelligent than 4 of them combined,1

ptr is hundred times in brilliance and in performance than modi and sitaraman excellent speach by tn finance minister a well educated and well known economist we need leaders like him to counter false narratives indian leaders become arrogant the power centers enjoy every thing free for life time from air to airplanes what about the poor,1
i am from jharkhand i liked dr ptrs so called arrogance we need more such educated ministers whole tn must be proud of him,1
not arrogance but boldness to speak out the fact naked truth i dream the day dr thyagarajan becoming indias finance minister ,1

thanks to all your support bitboy just announced he’s dropping the lawsuit presumably due to the backlash and financial support to atozy,1
big congratulations to bitboy guy managed to expose himself on a massive scale,1
amazing to see you supporting atozy looks like hes having a real tough time with it,1
well done in lending your support to atozy im sure you will help him in what ever he needs to fight this case like the obvious inconsistencies in his evaluation of his business ,1
hope you guys enjoyed this update dont forget that you can get the content that you are missing here on my other social channels  you also need to subscribe to my clips channel which has shorter market updates and livestreams,1
these videos are infinitely more helpful than the talking heads on cnbc keep up the great work guy always look forward to these,1
i’m a huge fan of you branching out into larger economics and not just crypto these videos are great,1
congrats guy you have metamorphed from a crypto knowledge expert to geopolitical expert great thoughts hope the chinese people are able to view this,1
great video guy love how you are diversifying and showing all sides of the economy instead of just crypto and you give other reporters a good run for their money guy do you think it doesnt matter how bad the chinese economy gets since the global village is slowly decoupling and when its all said and done china still has a substantial manifacturing base whereas the western manufacturing base has been mostly hollowed out i mean the west is mostly a service economy and not a manufacturing whats your prognosis,1
thank you guy i really appreciate the broader financial global economic perspective that your channel is pursuing beyond crypto your videos are always top notch full of logical insight entertaining and perfectly concise we appreciate all that you do,1
you’re doing great with the geopolitical news please continue to keep us update on what’s going on around the globe,1
great content as always i really appreciate the broader perspective and that the information is provided in a calm and matter of fact fashion without sensationalism i get much more insight from this than “traditional media” but i really missed the usual intro,1
guy long term follower here and financial risk manager with 10y experience i think you missed with this video while i agree that the risks are certainly there given the government power and the fact current interest rates in china are far higher then the west they have far more room to manoeuvre them self out of this crisis great content as always keep up the good work team coin bureau,1
thanks for this kind of macro finance videos extremely important for all markets,1
im new to cryptocurrency and i would really love to know about it i think this is the perfect opportunity to get positioned because from the predictions i have been seeing the bull season is close and i wouldnt want to miss it,1

i appreciate the content you put out on youtube i enjoy watching your videos i respect you for applying your experience and knowledge into an investment decision and putting your neck on the line by making it public you may be right on this trade but if you are right you better also short the us market as well because if the chinese market collapses it will pull down the us market with it thanks buddy previously bitcoin has been fluctuating between the 20k and 25k price marks billions of dollars have been wiped off due to the crash in its price particularly in the last four weeks the loss has become the primary cause of several firms’ liquidation issues in the crypto industry i think the direction is upward movement with a bit of silence before the storm agree its boring for the past few days a good strategy for hoddlerss moving forward would be to buy now and not get too excited to sell off with the upturn the rise will surprise everyone as for traders you make money anyways in both directions so just befriend the trend and use marketspotter to make informed decisions if you’re a modern investor then your main aim i guess would be to take home profits for yourself and family especially during times like this when reading the charts are extremely difficult due to its chronic volatility well goodnews you don’t have to worry about how this will come about just commit your investments with mrs robin moore and the rest will be a good history of profits for you i have been able to day trade my bitcoin to atop 1703 btc with 507 btc with her trade signal despite the state of the market her trade signal yield a lot of dividend only if you are paying attention to her instructions the good thing of this strategy is that whatever happens we have an opportunity to make some money trading with it not minding the sideways in the crypto market for helpguidance on buildinginvestingfinancial portfolio ͳeiєɠɾαm moorerobin,1
your channel has truly changed my life ive been studying and researching about crypto for a while now and i got stuck at some point on the learning curve now i can say im truly improving my understanding of this whole new world and making great profit weekly all thanks to you ,1
i watch your videos for your real talks and you never disappoint keep going youve reminded me of what someone once said the mind is the man the poor is in it and the rich is it too this sentence is the secret of most successful investors i once attended similar and ever since then i have been waxing strong financially and i most tell you the truth the bulls have been in control of the market for more than a month they have managed to push the price by more than 100 the majority of this rally has been without a considerable correction begging the question if one is pending following the test of the critical 2k level one thing is certain nobody knows what is going on our leadership in the country couldn’t be any worse from the press to the feds they are all terrible they say you can’t time the market but this one was easy to see coming every man woman and child no matter the age needs financial assistance doesn’t matter if your young or old we all need the stimulus check checks asap thats the major reason why one have to invest in crypto but not only investing rather invest and trade your assets for the gains its unfair on how things have turned up to be due to inflation things has been so difficult but btceth trading has helped me maintain financial stability although i believe that the benefits of successful trading come from an expert and that is why i made huge profits with the help of mr james wilson he is a genius and that is why i always advise beginnersinvestors to trade with professionals like him so far i have been able to increase my crypto trading portfolio from day trading from 107 btc to atop 1301 btc with the accurate trading signal provided to me by james and im an attestant to the accuracy of his trading strategy you all in search of a way to recover your looses from the crash and accumulate more profits can reach out to him for mentorship and profitable trading system on ͳeiєɠɾαm jameswilson21 cheers thank me later,1
great content i feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just naïve the sphere have seen far worse times than this enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions id say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than holding trading went smooth for me as i was able to raise over 102 btc when i started at 35 btc in just few weeks copying and implementing trades with signals and insights from feven lena i would advise y’all to trade your asset rather than hold for a future you arent sure about,1
im glad i got into cryptocurrencies back then because it was a turning point for me financially and was my best decision so far,1
lol so we’ve gone full circle no longer proof of work no longer proof of stake but now proof of authority or trust which is essentially where we are already but now we are branding it with blockchain technology so it sounds exciting,1

despite the dip in crypto i still thank you for the levelheaded financial advice i started forex and crypto investment with 4345 and since following you for few weeks now i’ve gotten 18539 in my portfolio thanks so much mrs marie georgiana,1
high inflation was never a reason to sellthe definition of inflation is that prices go up versus fiat essentially logically that would make sense even for stocks but especially for a commodity thats been known for many years as an inflation hedge my growing love for crypto caused me to explore until i came across alice marcella although im trying to avoid sensationalism alice is by far the best no hype for hypes sake but great inspiration to trade crypto the market has been irrational for far too long what were seeing today is a small correction of the illogical selling pressure,1
keep up the great work the market price can best be described by logarithmic regression in my own opinion these kinds of ups and downs are nothing new meanwhile chad leon is doing a great job with his signals as ive been able to accumulate over 17btc with his help hes a pro in the crypto space and im no longer bothered about the market prices,1
great video and some nice tips this is a scary time for new investors but the best thing you can do is not to make decisions based on emotions this could actually be a good time to buy more of your high conviction stocks or crypto on a discount wealth is created during bear markets not bull markets if your portfolio is really effecting your mental health then delete the app and go for a walk let the market do its thing and have a long time horizon i buy and just trade long term more than ever i have made over 19 btc from day trading with karen gauvin in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish,1

we have been on a recession since the beginning of 2022 but big media and governments all over the world didn’t want to admit it we need to be wise and use our brains knowledge is power and i’d like all the family to be powerful just purchased some amztc3 thanks for keeping us informed during this times of doubt,1
despite suffering severe selloff in the face of uncertainties in the macro landscape btc ebbing tide seems to be subsiding with key metrics suggesting the cryptocurrency is poised to come ahead ark invest recently pointed out the 200 weekly moving average a key indicator that is signaling btc could soon reclaim its lost glory i buy and just trade long term more than ever i have made over 15 btc from trading with judith sherwood crypto in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish,1
despite the economic downturnim so happy i have been earning 60000 returns from my 10000 investment every 14days,1
rumors were that amazon would launch amz this month and judging from this its pretty accurate haha,1
thank you for the update amztc3 is done right and waiting is part of the process,1
what i love about you is that you never speak your bias as gospel you give everyone the freedom to decide for themselves without shoving your bias down their throats and potentially brainwashing them to think what you think you present each argument clearly and concisely i have made over 23btc from day trading with alice marcella signal in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish,1
even with the current dip in crypto currency’s i’m so happy i can still smile back at my portfolio of 71280 built from my weekly trade i’m having my 4th withdrawal in 10business days ,1

i like your administration man i got my house with the assets of this wire i’m glad l settled on the correct decision via the name above credit to you sir,1
i love the grounded reality of this channeli started in crypto in august 2017 and i bought ini was up 5x by december only to watch that disappear quickly and then watch the original investment go down by about 85 during the ensuing 4 year bear market i took the opportunity to accumulate more over the last 4 years which was hard to do and at the same time a smart thing to do i wish i had bought more i am in profit for now but i am planning on using my experience and what i have learnt from dickson jenkinshave learned from you and other youtubrs especially my mentor dickson jenkins who taught me how to make trade and increase my crypto from 2btc to 13btc that no one really knows what is going to happen in the market and i know you are only saying what you think will happen based on the past it is yours and my opinion so people should make their own investment choices based on their own research,1
yeah ive been able to withdraw my initial investment and some profits from coswift arbitrage i still think this is still unreal though this wont last long term but at this point im making 3236 a daily if this doest go well ill be ok,1
perry omg i use to set a reminder that always ring with a note saying “don’t get too greedy” lol… coswift arbitrage has automated things for me now i don’t have to worry about market movement,1
what’s the best choice investing in real estates or crypto because i have been thinking crypto seems to be one of the most promising at the moment,1
great platform for auto crypto arbitrage but i think the speed in which btc is deposited to the coswift account can be increase,1
i must say that you are the most erudite and smart analyst in the crypto space first of all youre just awesome ive been following for months now and the cinematic videos excellent insight and comedic tone are outstanding before anything else i would like to say that no one can exactly predict in days how long a bear or bull market could last or how low and high the prices can go but we can try to make predictions using past events i think prices should run up a lot now punishing panic sellers and forced sellers most new traders struggle at first to make sense of the markets and how to put their portfolios in a position to flourish many try to start on their own and quickly end up with a string of losses slowly seeing their accounts dwindle to what they started off as everyone is looking at the bitcoin price action from a 2021 bull run perspective everything has changed…we are in a recession facing stagflation rising rates and energy shortages driving food and living costs through the roof breaking consumers’ backs there are different strategies to profit from the crypto market but holding and waiting for a major pump is not the best way to earn profits off the market smart investors trade and take shortterm profits ive made over 11’ btc with 21’ btc retail trading not on my own but with the help of a professional who has reputable background and understanding of the market kyle miller i came across his channel where he shares his charts the selling fatigue will wane and the market will reset historically fortune favored the ones who bought in thought moments in moments of uncertainty when prices traded close to the 200wmayou can reach mr kyle on ͳeiєɠɾαm kylemiller3 cheers thank me later,1
im supporting atozy all the way,1
this only means one thingpamp will go to the moon but for real it is good to see these guys get exposed by orhers in the community that means btc is losing ground and the truth eventually will come out,1
like elon musk stated for tesla the only thing that matters is the speed of innovation the bitcoins and ethereums of today are picking up with new and innovative use cases the old ways will die out because they can not change and adapt quick enough with the changing times hodl oh yeah arcane bear is a beast would love to hear more insights from him,1
arcane could definitely host an ”after dark” show,1
so bitcoin is still worth buying if you have usdt,1
love arcane bears vibe keep having him on the show,1
this is helpful thankyou for this content you are awesome,1
success seems to be connected with action successful people keep moving they make mistake but they dont quit the stock market has plenty of opportunities to earn a decent payouts with the right skills and proper understanding of how the market works,1
i always appreciate your levelheaded nohype approach to the markets and macro economic picture when newbies swarm to crypto in the next bull run and have to decide between all the clickbait bitcoin boys these are the kind of videos that should reassure them that you are the real deal thanks for your hard work and integrity here,1

the way you explained the psychology of each wave educated me so much thank you bcb have followed for years and you always bring value to the space,1
i love how you do focus on more than just crypto two quick questions if we do start wave 5 any guess as to roughly what the peak would be is that the overall 4236 extension second what happens next if it hits that overall high i expect a crash but what if wave 5 doesnt get that high,1
awesome video bcb thank you but what does wave 5 in the stock market mean for the alt coin market would we have enough time for eth to finish that fractal you mentioned the beginning of the super cycle also the merge is coming in a few weeks is bitcoin going up to 40k considered a retracement that we need for the alt coin season we all want,1
what i love about you is that you never speak your bias as gospel you give everyone the freedom to decide for themselves without shoving your bias down their throats and potentially brainwashing them to think what you think you present each argument clearly and concisely i particularly love the breakdown explanation of elliot wave theory and what actually happens psychologically with the market participants well done brother have a good one ,1
absolutely love the discussions about the stock markets your crypto approach is tied to the performance of bitcoin which is usually tied to the stock market your stock market analysis helps to solidify your approach to crypto keep it up,1
amazing video just learning about the different waves really helps thanks for everything you do my dude helps plebs like me learn 3,1
an updated price prediction would be good or confirmation that your previous targets for the alts are still in tact i’m presuming they are not but think it would be useful to understand what prices you are expecting if btc retraces thanks ,1
thanks for what you do bcb ive learned so much from you man,1

crypto and other markets have some rough roads ahead but as albert einstein once said “life is like riding a bicycle to keep your balance you must keep moving” we will get through it,1
i think the difference in this instance is that analysts are stating that we are heading for a depression so this changes everything in the grand scheme of things when talking about possible new aths great points in your video i agree and suspect it may be too convenient to think btc is perfectly correlated to spnasdaq and altcoins to btc refreshing to hear reasonable market analysis that takes a bigger picture perspective so many people are squabbling over timing the exact bottom that shortterm thinking is such a rookie mistake by dollar cost averaging and holding for several years it takes the guesswork out next bull runs it wont be a huge deal if we bought at 21k or 17k what will matter is that we are accumulating while the price is relatively low im really holding on for this possible low point reentry i screwed up some time back i need this lower point to get back in i’ve small cash on the sideline i dont like that but i refuse to fomo in our younger investors are scared theyre concerned about what they should do because a lot of them have not been through this before my advice to them is this go all out into trading trading is where the bucks are been made i see the stock market housing values going down and crypto going up traditional markets are getting recked the new economy is crypto not fiat people want truth not corruption contracts not monetary easing venturing into crypto trading investment has been a turning point for me with the help and tutoring from my investment advisor mrkyle miller with his guides and the trade signal i use in trading i have moved from having 58 btc to atop 173 btc in a short period of time invest today and trade your crypto assets with the best tutor trader ͳeiєɠɾαm kylemiller3 for more info or mentorship on how to invest trade and earn with his topnotch trade signal,1

100 with you mate we my girlfriend and i are making moves to be able to solely focus our efforts during the bear market and have been liquidating our assets and in the coming weeks moving to a low risk low cost lower tax environment to be able to optimise all our efforts crypto and digital assets is the global revolution for man kind spiritually and culturally and our environment it sounds extreme and cultish but when on a precipice these extreme changes happen bitcoin is energy and economic jesus much love and thank you for the content,1
great stuff elio am totally with you ty for the daily input you give us my specialty are gaming launchpads cos it combines defi nfts and metaverse and if gaming is the future and we dont know which projects will win than quality gaming launchpads are the best bet anyone can take no influencer covers this topic in great detail i have developed advanced strategies which work like a swiss clock all thx to listening to you guys and taking what works and discarding what doesnt too many people take you guys too literally there are just sooo many advantages to gaming launchpads over layer 1s and other projects i made a fortune last year with seedify and other projects now making amazing passive income during the winter times am focused on finding new amazing launchpads such as spintop spores etc anything with great teams vision and tokenomics just loving this bear market to the max 3 give me more,1
no doubt the best bear market drinking game is taking a shot every time ellio says “the reality is”,1
that was a good one i agree,1
i like it when your videos have positivity and optimism everyone in crypto right now especially on twitter are ultra focused on the bear and further downward pressure like we get it we know it may come we may sink lower sideways whatever… personally i also have conviction and totally click with what you are saying about gaming i know the market will return but for now i am not interested in talking about price more so what is being built so many exciting projects like defi kingdoms star atlas and many more all building through the bear even your own projects id be happy just to listen to videos on what is going on rather than what the prices are doing,1
the market seems really interesting now i think it may go even lower and ill accumulate some more usdt before that happens to be ready,1
3651 im honestly impressed by the time and effort you put into these videos keep it up ,1
great stuff i watch several youtube videos on how to trade in the market but havent made any headstart because they are either talking some gibberish or sharing their story of how they made it and i do not want to make mistakes by taking risks in my own hands,1
i used to feel overwhelmed when my portfolio would drop a few dollars now that ive learned how the market works i see bear markets as a giant opportunity to build generational wealth for me and my family in just 5 months my portfolio have accrued gains of over 300k,1
my favourite crypto person online great content like always casey thank you loads,1
wonderfully explained you rock i promise you that one of these leading cable financial news channels need to scoop you up before 2023 phelix,1
i love your videos and even when your doing fluff vids like ape nft footage like less than 1 of earth it still feels like you really care plus you always tell us to take profits you awesome,1
hi casey can i ask something please thank you for your great videos i was thinking about stablecoins do traders convert btc into a stablecoin when they feel the price is high and wait until the price drops down and buy back by converting back into btc is this what people do also would convertions into different cryptos be classed as a selling it for tax purposes thank you for any advice all the best kieron,1
i learnt a lot from this teamits been a while since i joined the discord and the patrons of cheeky cryptoi applied what you discuss in my day to day trading the gain was massivei am leverage trader and your insights always valuablethank you for your effort and daily videos,1
this is the best ew presentation on yt i so resonate with the no bs straight up say it like it is lessons during review ty nick,1
thank you for making me aware about the chiliz trend made a great trade in it and felt like a rational trader way more than an emotional one of course also on my own research but want to let you know that cheeky crypto helps a lot with making wise decisions,1
streams getting better and better you guys are on fire lately,1
im still not convinced thats 5 waves down it looks equally like it could be a 335 abc to me other then that you did a great job explaining and everything was quite logical,1
thanks for the info always appreciated,1
hands down one of the best crypto channels mad respect keep it up ps love that youre consistent and repetitive that is how we humans learn best take care warm regards from scandinavia,1
always good to hear your thoughtful and logical analysis i dont care about bullish or bearish market trade a small percentage of your portfolio rather than going in and out every couple weeks trying to time the market trading went smooth for me as i was able to raise over 84 btc when i started at 3 btc in just few weeks implementing richard daily signals and tips,1
trying to make sense of cryptocurrencies can be a bit overwhelming for investors its a nascent but promising asset class built on technology that has the potential to disrupt a wide range of industries for investors whats probably most attractive is the possibility of lifechanging returns dont worry youre not late to the crypto party were likely still in the very early innings leaving you with lots of time to put money to work and learn about this burgeoning market if youre new to crypto then my advise is that you trade with the guidance of an expert i have learned from alot of youtubers especially my mentor gerard mcdonald who taught me how to make trade and increase my portfolio to 19 btc lately,1
i appreciate your help on recovering my bitcoin wallet and i hope to continue working with you for future bitcoin issues,1
i appreciate your help on recovering my bitcoin wallet and i hope to continue working with you for future bitcoin issues,1
thanks for the update i always appreciate the insight im really blown away by the fact that having watched your videos for so long i had the same opinion that you are putting forth in this video in as much i would like to add to what you have said here the market is in a tug of war with the bull at one side and the bears at the other end if this is really a bear market rally then bitcoin is not done going down just like stocks are not done going down and if this isn’t a bear market rally and the fed achieves a soft landing bitcoin will probably rally substantially from where it is now but we just have to wait and see my hope is that by the fourth quarter the economy will be slowing enough that the fed says we are going to pause and then you will see the next crypto cycle start i have witnessed the last 3 cycles and just before each bull run the amount of bear posts and negativity around crypto is just like it is now bitcoin is entering the area of where a bottom will be formed imo please note this could take months and there will likely be further volatility in both directions despite the volatility that has ruled the market this year being a retail trader in the crypto market and implementing strategiessignals from eddie crypto a professional brokertradr that has been my mentor i have accumulated 12 btc in profits although the rates are capricious wiping out some of my profits people who are open to learning from history will survive it’s not that difficult you can reach out to mr eddie on ͳeiєɠɾαm his personal handle is edcrypto8 or whatsapp✙18053284321‬,1
i really appreciate your clear and simple breakdown on financial pitfalls i lost so much on cryptos but now making around 917k every week trading different on stocks and cryptocurrencies using wtrade inspects,1

exactly what i was looking for thank you,1
amazing video first time hearing about atr and ill defiantly be playing around with this,1
great platform for auto crypto arbitrage but i think the speed in which btc is deposited to the coswift account can be increase,1
great video clear and concise explanations,1
i sincerely appreciate the knowledge you share if you have been closely watching the crypto or even invested in it chances are that you are wondering whether the latest bear cycle is over the truth is that the market remains unpredictable especially in the longterm despite the heavy outflows bitcoin still managed to promptly recover this recovery demonstrated bitcoin’s strength despite being stress tested against highly volatile and unfavorable market conditions could this outcome be a sign that the market is ready for a bigger recovery the obvious answers is yes despite how long it might take it is very important to stay ahead of the market by trading with the right strategy i have been trading with boston weber’s signals and strategy for 3 weeks which i have been able to accumulate 108 btc with his signals he’s a trader i believe everyone else can also work it,1
money is an issue that everyone has for a better and luxurious life life was really hell for me until i got into crypto investment since 2016 and am actually glad i started crypto when i did because it’s been a turning point for me financially i cant ever regret making the greatest move that has changed my life financially today,1
i think this is a classic trend channel that entered in from the top and exited out the bottom ethereum did not do this and made you think it was bullish the price entered the trend from the bottom and exited the bottom big thanks to alice marcella for helping me earn over 27btc by implementing her method and following her guide,1
i will forever appreciate this channel and mrs victoria wiezorekyouve helped my family alot your videos advice lessons and funny words are inspirational and helpful to us my wife and i have been able to be minimal conscious in spending saving and investing wisely i now earn every week youre such a blessing to this generation we all love you,1
so many factors come to play to sustain trade momentum of course sir richard friedman brings to all a unique positive incentive policies market expansion and strong global demand we believe this factors combined with other market technical forces have triggered a significant reduction in the market’s implied risk premium for all assets,1
hit 120k today thank you for all the knowledge and nuggets you had thrown my way over the last months started with 14k in june 2022,1
thanks for all you do i like your truthful coverage mad respect for educating everyone btcs price has been fluctuating lately but i think we should be educating the newbies on what to do aside holding rather than discussing about the dip the good thing about the space is that you can buy the dips and put them into active trades making profits from trades while confidently waiting for a pump in price because it is inevitable most people do not understand how the space works your advantage is understanding charts won’t guarantee what an asset is going to do prices will go up or down nevertheless the market has been so profitable despite price ups and down ive always played safe implementing trades with insights and signals from a renowned trader ruby benally i made 85 btc from the recent crash in the market within a period of five weeks,1
always good to hear your thoughtful and logical analysis that small rally was a fake out we are entering a crab market i dont care about bearish market trade a small percentage of your portfolio rather than going in and out every couple weeks trying to time the market trading went smooth for me implementing wtrade inspects daily trading signals and tips,1

keep fighting the good fight not sure how hard this thing will run but i cant argue with the overall game plan,1
i read that tweet yesterday and im glad you got at him there are so many naysayers when it comes to luna classic its pathetic we dont need that negative energy around us i have faith that luna classic will work this will show new crypto currency companies how they can be run,1
thank you for watching intro 0000 this bitcoin price prediction played out almost perfect 0025 bitcoin and stock market 100 bitcoin halving 145 btc pattern of 3 events 500,1
great video… love the guts to call this bottom formation great analysis hope you’re right will continue accumulating hope inflation doesn’t bite us all in the butt,1
i don’t disagree we will have to watch but we now have more btc adoption and big money playing with stock market ideals keep up the good work see you soon,1
among a short list watch you every day bro keep up the great work,1
great points in your video i agree and suspect it may be too convenient to think btc is perfectly correlated to spnasdaq and altcoins to btc what do i know…time will tell,1
these are really tough times for the whole market most of the top coins are down but the token fans are still growing psg rbif sat arsand these are all very potential project that can be held for a long time to wc,1

thank you brother,1
dude now that was the best intro yet i have 30 month’s of data to support that statement ,1
awesome analysis  as always right hand salute  sir,1
this channel got me into cubing and i’ve realized how fun it actually is ,1
love the way the iphone is just sitting there,1
like 6 months ago i was level 60 but i solved the magic volcano with no help and solved the sudoku cube with a tutorial which automatically made me level 100,1
i am proud of myself for learning a 4×4 level58 at the age of 12,1
lets just appreciate the fact that jperm almost remembered all those names,1
jperm shows off his massive collection me looks at my 1 cheap 3x3 i found at a toy store edit i just hit 1k likes yay i never thought this comment would still be getting replies and likes lol,1
i have the yj yulong v2 and in my personal opinion i think it’s a pretty great cube to start out with,1
i would love to have this collection ,1
you make the type of video i can watch over and over again love  the content i have watched this over 20 times,1
i don’t even cube i just watch these videos because they’re satisfying and i find it interesting how enthusiasts of different things talk,1
i am surprised that the 200 cube collection took less than 14 minutes this was the best collection video ever created,1
this was so easily explained that i had to watch it a billion times,1
works perfectly giving us a bunch of things to do but not how to do them literally a masterclass,1
i watched it a trillion times in 025x speed but thank you because of you i solved my very 1st rubics cube and i belive that if i practice thoroughly ill be able to solve without any issues thank you bright side,1
finally after 32 years i was able to solve the rubiks cube without cheating peeling off the stickers thanks a lot for this guide,1
very well explained it took 4hrs straight to keep solving it with all the algorithm in the video those trying to solve from this video keep practising the algorithm step by step and solve it,1
this was really helpful thank you ,1
people say this every year but its astounding how z3 scrambles all his cubes just for a five second clip at the beginning,1
most people dream of having half your collection i love the vids so much im getting a 5x5 today,1

im sorry for the spam but My name is Jenny. I go to high school where  everyone dresses fashionable but for me I don't because i need money to buy  cute clothes. I have low self esteem . I live with my dad. my mom passed  away when i was 6 so i don't really have a mother figure. I have 2 brothers  who is older than me. Since they are boys they get the attention while i  just be alone. I really want to wear pretty clothes like the girls in my  school and get a boyfriend. i just can't be my self. im very quite and shy  at school because i don't have the confidence in myself to talk to someone.  i did have one friend name Caroline but she moved away so now im alone. if  you could donate some money to me it would be great. i don't care about  expensive brand ill just shop at walmart because they have pretty clothes.  also i wanna get my nails done at a salon . i see alot of girls have these  french tips. i never had my nail did at a salon before i will really  appreciate if i can and get my hair curled too. http://www.gofundme.com/dressprettyonce thanks omg please.﻿,2

"A  friend of mine has invented a big dick formula. He had a small dick (4  inches) and he did some research about this topic. During the research, he  found out the secret knowledge of penis enlargement. He applied what he  had learned and now he has a 7 inch dick. He was absolutely amazed by his  results. Of course, it took a few months. Therefore, he has written a book  about this issue in order to help guys. He asked me to promote his book :)  So, guys if you are interested and for more info check this out  https://payhip.com/b/oTIb  . He is selling it for symbolic £1. Thank you ;)﻿",2

"I really love watching football and also I’ve started off making income with out financial risk from acquiring bonus deals. It’s this weird technique where you wager on something with one bookmakers and bet against it on Betfair. You secure the bonus as income . A chap named Jim Vanstone is finding the wagers free on his own website Vanstone Secrets (Google it!). I’ve made about 500 quid thus far. And it is cost-free. I guess the bookies pay him to obtain new consumers, yet this actually works.",2

The britishs called that soccer but you know the true word is football and the US Foot is called rugby. That works like that in EUW ( Germany/ Netherland/ France/ Portugal/ Belgium/ Spain/ ... ) Just because the Britishs don&#39;t agree to be like us because they are UNIQUE. That&#39;s the reason why they also refused to have euro (€) as money,2

"Okay pay attention, this is not the one to miss. BNTY and PRL have proven in the last week that anything that touches Kucoin is going to surge. Now DBC (Deep Brain Chain) is on the same path, as you can see it has the highest trading volume on KuCoin. On the other hand Kucoin&#39;s total daily trading volume is sitting at a tiny $32m compared to Binance&#39;s $2.8b and Binance is only 5 months old. Kucoin has grown 800% in the last 60 days and it&#39;s aggressive listing of new unknown coins such as BNTY and DBC is going to be a major contributor to this growth. We&#39;re at a point now where normies are seeing this: <a href=""https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kucoin-shares/"">https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kucoin-shares/</a> or <a href=""https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/deepbrain-chain/"">https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/deepbrain-chain/</a> and scrambling to get onboard with the moon missions.<br><br>How do you take advantage of Kucoin&#39;s growth? KuCoin Shares.<br><br>KuCoin is dead serious about being a major force in the exchange world. They want growth and they want it fast - to facilitate this they&#39;re offering dividends in the form of trading fees to their investors. 50% of the entire trading fee revenue on the Kucoin platform will be shared daily with those holding KCS on their exchange. This is a two-fold investment with ridiculous growth potential as a result, you buy KCS, the exchange grows, your KCS rises in price, and the amount of dividends you are generating grows with it.<br><br>My current plan is to ride our /biz/ alt-coin profit and reinvest into KCS down the line. See you in 2020 when I&#39;m still holding and living off my dividends, I hope you are there with me.<br><br>Kucoin&#39;s referral system is genius too; you are rewarded some % of the trading fees that your invitees take on. If I shilled you into this Godcoin please consider using my referral code when signing up if you don&#39;t have a Kucoin account yet: <a href=""https://www.kucoin.com/#/?r=1h26P"">https://www.kucoin.com/#/?r=1h26P</a>",2

"Charts appear to say &gt;19.3k&lt; bottom i could see that, but not with the macro situation though. I dont even think talkin bout the bottom is worth it atm. Macro is the worst in decades energy, inflation, rate hikes, supply shortages etc etc its the perfect storm. From 2008ish till around 2021 when the economy was boomin &amp; the fed was printing money btc still crash about 85%. So i find it hard to accept a 75% crash for a bear market that lines up with a global recession, dont make sense to me. Institutions &amp; whales need retail to sell so theres enough supply to meet their demand &amp; they aint buyin yet!! The thing is retail aint got any money to ape in to btc atm &amp; over the next 12 months or so i see less money in the system as the fed tightens &amp; everything goes up in price. So where will the money come from in that kind of a setting?? I really dont think weve seen the bottom yet or the kind of pain coming next year after mid terms. I guess we will see, I will keep buy and just trade long term more than ever, I have made over 1.5` btc from trading with Harrys Dent in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish .Re?a?c?h? h?im V?I?A?

"I love this video because he gives real strategies for growth of your holdings during unstable market times or even downward market periods. <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>However his explanation for why crypto is staked is let�s say imperfect. Staking is a replacement and upgrade to traditional mining and less energy intensive. It returns value similar to mining. Without having a server/GPU farm.

"Interesting consideration, have to consider digital land probably won&#39;t function like physical land obviously but I see application. The issue right now is no one can foresee where this space is heading. Metaverse is an obvious choice in purchasing land as it&#39;s backed by FB but when I bought my VR headset a lot of people didn&#39;t want to have any association with FB like having to create an account to access their VR profile. I think if fears of future pandemics persist people will be more willing to stay home and interact on VR for shopping and social events, not to mention viewing events in other countries without the costs of flying, etc. There&#39;s a lot of potential and opportunity to integrate with cryptocurrency when you deal with the right source like EXTREMETOPPERS??COM but there&#39;s probably a long way until a platform exists for it.<br><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>",2

On the other hand, I consider the opportunity cost of not owning crypto these days to be much of a much higher risk. That is to say, I think _not _owning crypto is far more risky than owning it, due to various things not limited to stupid fiscal policies and Fed money printing.

"Interesting consideration, have to consider digital land probably won&#39;t function like physical land obviously but I see application. The issue right now is no one can foresee where this space is heading. Metaverse is an obvious choice in purchasing land as it&#39;s backed by FB but when I bought my VR headset a lot of people didn&#39;t want to have any association with FB like having to create an account to access their VR profile. I think if fears of future pandemics persist people will be more willing to stay home and interact on VR for shopping and social events, not to mention viewing events in other countries without the costs of flying, etc. There&#39;s a lot of potential and opportunity to integrate with cryptocurrency when you deal with the right source like Virtualcryptomines??com but there&#39;s probably a long way until a platform exists for it<a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>",2
"Trying to make sense of cryptocurrencies can be a bit overwhelming for investors. &lt; It&#39;s a nascent but promising asset class built on technology that has the potential to disrupt a wide range of industries. For investors, what&#39;s probably most attractive is the possibility of life-changing returns. Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re not late to the crypto party. We&#39;re likely still in the very early innings, leaving you with lots of time to put money to work and learn about this burgeoning market. If you&#39;re new to crypto then my advise is that you trade with the guidance of an expert. I have learned from alot of Youtubers especially my mentor <b>Linux Tech Corps</b> , who taught me how to make trade and increase my portfolio to 7.4 btc lately.",2
"As a first timer venturing into cryptocurrency investments, this course has been fairly insightful as it covers all the basics of understanding cryptocurrency markets and the relevant chart analysis techniques.

"I love this video because he gives real strategies for growth of your holdings during unstable market times or even downward market periods. However his explanation for why crypto is staked is let�s say imperfect. Staking is a replacement and upgrade to traditional mining and less energy intensive. It returns value similar to mining. Without having a server/GPU farm. Proof of stake is the next generation of coin creation and value creation. Bur before then, I&#39;ve been trading with <b>Linux Tech Corps</b> and it&#39;s very profitable",2
I started to look into NFTs to build more my knowledge. Your video was simple and very enjoyable to watch so thank you for publishing this content.

"Retiring from public service made me realize that I had not attained financial independence, and in 25 years, I had only moved round in circles financially.

"Their firm is absolutely outstanding! You mentioned that I would start seeing progress around a month and that is absolutely true.

I am extremely pleased with the way you worked things out for me. I will definitely suggest your services to any of my friends or relatives if they will ever experience any problem with their credit.",2
"I don&#39;t consider renting passive income unless you have professional property management. Most people who rent don&#39;t count their time and effort needed just to make a tiny return on their massive investment. For example, you invest $599,000 to buy a second home and rent it out for $3000 a month. Let assume you are cash flow positive on the property and you make $1000 a month or $12,000 a year. What would your annualized return be? 2 percent on the entire amount. Now, you can argue that your return is much higher since you only put down $120,000 on the property. However, you are on the hook for the full $600k regardless of what the future FMV of the house is. Furthermore, people assume that their home will always appreciate in value however, this is a false assumption you can make. In the best case, you will gain some capital appreciation thanks to the central bank increasing the money supply, however, if inflation heats up, you can see your property actually start to lose money in real terms. This is because there is an inverse relationship between housing and nominal interest rates. The central bank will attempt to slow down inflation with higher interest rates and curb lending. We haven&#39;t seen inflation in a big way but we can see all the massive stimulus money that the government is pumping turn into inflation while taxes will be hiked to pay for all the COVID spending, your best choice is to look into <b>FUTUREIMPERATIVECORPS</b> Its more profitable.",2
"Extremely point by point video Well I will also say this here, Most people don&#39;t understand the concept of &quot;buying the dip&quot; buying the dip is all about buying digital assets when their prices are down and selling off when the price rises. Holding is great, although trading is far more profitable. I was able to grasp the knowledge of trading crypt0 assets early enough, but I was still limited due to my lack of technical understanding of how to analyze the digital market, all that changed when I encountered <b>Linux Tech Corps</b> , I must confess it was easier to understand with the assistance of Andy that has made me over good ?oin.",2
"Your information is priceless and i find it truly baffling as youtubers completely look at TA and ignore the bigger narrative of why there is a pump. Btc pumped due to the future ETF release, It&#39;s kind of irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peak of BTC.The entire space has always been volatile that&#39;s why we must always back up our crypto so that you do not have to be bothered when it goes bearish.I have always played safe in the space with a less talked about medium, trad ing.Rather than buying the dip and waiting for a pump, I just get to trade my assets with insight and signal provision from <b>Linux Tech Corps</b> I have made over 7 btc in January alone.",2
"The regular lending rates on FTX are quite good compared to most banks, but they fluctuate by the hour (and also intra-hour, but you&#39;re generally not paid for that). Meanwhile staking is a set yearly amount that seldom changes, but then you have to find a good entry and bare the risk that entails. On the other hand, I consider the opportunity cost of not owning crypto these days to be much of a much higher risk. That is to say, I think _not _owning crypto is far more risky than owning it, due to various things not limited to stupid fiscal policies and Fed money printing. So the best is owing it, trading and investing with it, I learned that from a crypto expert from <b>Future Imperative Corps</b> I&#39;ve made tons of profits btw",2
"I hold high respect for your work mate because you&#39;re pointing people in the right direction. If there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve learnt recently is to remain calm especially when it comes to investment in cryptocurrency. Let&#39;s not panic and sell when when everything goes down and do not buy in euphoria when everything goes up. I advise everyone to forget predictions and start making profits now because future valuations are all speculations and guesses. The trade market is unstable and you can&#39;t easily tell if it&#39;s going bullish or bearish. While Myself and my colleagues are trading without fear of incurring loses, others are being patient for the price of skyrocket. It all depends on the pattern you follow.

"Credit score is not something used in all countries though. In France, they determine if you are eligible to get a loan (e.g., to buy a house) based on the ratio between your salary, your expenses and your savings. Basically, if every month you &#39;burn&#39; all your money, you&#39;re perceived as riskier than someone earning less but consistently making deposits to a saving account. I feel in the US people tend to buy things they don&#39;t need with money they don&#39;t have... The only times I feel one should need a credit is when buying &#39;big&#39; things (house, car, etc.). Not for a TV. I�m 26 with over 800 credit score, time was put into that to build it up by <b>Future imperative corps</b>",2

"Credit score is not something used in all countries though.

"<b>I don&#39;t consider renting passive income unless you have professional property management. Most people who rent don&#39;t count their time and effort needed just to make a tiny return on their massive investment. For example, you invest $599,000 to buy a second home and rent it out for $3000 a month. Let assume you are cash flow positive on the property and you make $1000 a month or $12,000 a year. What would your annualized return be? 2 percent on the entire amount. Now, you can argue that your return is much higher since you only put down $120,000 on the property. However, you are on the hook for the full $600k regardless of what the future FMV of the house is. Furthermore, people assume that their home will always appreciate in value however, this is a false assumption you can make. In the best case, you will gain some capital appreciation thanks to the central bank increasing the money supply, however, if inflation heats up, you can see your property actually start to lose money in real terms. This is because there is an inverse relationship between housing and nominal interest rates. The central bank will attempt to slow down inflation with higher interest rates and curb lending. We haven&#39;t seen inflation in a big way but we can see all the massive stimulus money that the government is pumping turn into inflation while taxes will be hiked to pay for all the COVID spending, your best choice is to look into VCORPINVEST Its more profitable.</b><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>",2

"don&#39;t consider renting passive income unless you have professional property management. Most people who rent don&#39;t count their time and effort needed just to make a tiny return on their massive investment. For example, you invest $599,000 to buy a second home and rent it out for $3000 a month. Let assume you are cash flow positive on the property and you make $1000 a month or $12,000 a year. What would your annualized return be? 2 percent on the entire amount. Now, you can argue that your return is much higher since you only put down $120,000 on the property. However, you are on the hook for the full $600k regardless of what the future FMV of the house is. Furthermore, people assume that their home will always appreciate in value however, this is a false assumption you can make. In the best case, you will gain some capital appreciation thanks to the central bank increasing the money supply, however, if inflation heats up, you can see your property actually start to lose money in real terms. This is because there is an inverse relationship between housing and nominal interest rates. The central bank will attempt to slow down inflation with higher interest rates and curb lending. We haven&#39;t seen inflation in a big way but we can see all the massive stimulus money that the government is pumping turn into inflation while taxes will be hiked to pay for all the COVID spending, your best choice is to look into support@ MONEYHAVENINVESTMENT??ORG Its the video.<a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>",2

"Glad to see this video, thank you ?? ?? The biggest challenges for investors can range from controlling impulsiveness to the frailty of coercion. Most new investors often undermine and neglect the importance of technical analysis when it comes to Bitcoin trading. Technical analysis overly predicts the movement of asset prices regardless of what is happening in the broader or broader market. In essence, the process is to examine the paths of a particular asset movement in the past to create a sustainable pattern that can be used to predict future movements.

"I don&#39;t consider renting passive income unless you have professional property management. Most people who rent don&#39;t count their time and effort needed just to make a tiny return on their massive investment. For example, you invest $599,000 to buy a second home and rent it out for $3000 a month. Let assume you are cash flow positive on the property and you make $1000 a month or $12,000 a year. What would your annualized return be? 2 percent on the entire amount. Now, you can argue that your return is much higher since you only put down $120,000 on the property. However, you are on the hook for the full $600k regardless of what the future FMV of the house is. Furthermore, people assume that their home will always appreciate in value however, this is a false assumption you can make. In the best case, you will gain some capital appreciation thanks to the central bank increasing the money supply, however, if inflation heats up, you can see your property actually start to lose money in real terms. This is because there is an inverse relationship between housing and nominal interest rates. The central bank will attempt to slow down inflation with higher interest rates and curb lending. We haven&#39;t seen inflation in a big way but we can see all the massive stimulus money that the government is pumping turn into inflation while taxes will be hiked to pay for all the COVID spending, your best choice is to look into VCORPINVEST Its more profitable<a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>",2

"Trying to make sense of cryptocurrencies can be a bit overwhelming for investors. &lt; It&#39;s a nascent but promising asset class built on technology that has the potential to disrupt a wide range of industries. For investors, what&#39;s probably most attractive is the possibility of life-changing returns. Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re not late to the crypto party. We&#39;re likely still in the very early innings, leaving you with lots of time to put money to work and learn about this burgeoning market.

"My family and friends have been investing with VladimirCorp since May 2019. We are now invested in about 15 loans, including those in our retirement accounts. My Investment Representative and the Loan Processing staff are terrific. I like the power to choose the loans in which we invest�not like many other firms where you give them $$$ and they choose the loans in which to invest on your behalf. Around the 15th of each month interest income is direct deposited into our bank accounts. There have been no delinquencies, even during the height of the pandemic in 2020. Investing in a loan is so easy�sign documents online, have one document notarized and deposit the funds into Ignite�s account at Bank of America. When loans are paid off, my Investment Representative and/or the Loan Processing dept alerts us so that we may roll-over the funds into another loan. This proactive approach minimizes the time our money is not earning interest.",2
"A reason why I chose VladimirCorp was because of their low administration fees and costs. Another big reason was that my money would be secured on the Allan Gray accounts, I am very happy with the service I get from the consultants there because I always get a speedy response when I have queries, which is a huge advantage in my busy life. Although I invest my money at my own risk I get expert advice which helps me a lot with my decisions.",2

I know doing technical analysis can be quite difficult which is why most newbies / Trader&#39;s neglect day trading their coins and stick to hodling which is very dangerous as when the market goes bearish,they loose their investment.

"I invested in Tesla back in 2013, I was very much a bear. My reasoning was simple: Tesla was trying to do what no American automaker had done so far: Develop and sell a mass-market electric vehicle. It was trying to do what no American company had done in nearly a century: Start up a successful new auto manufacturing business. To take it a step further, I bought 40 shares from Tesla miners, investing about $1,800 in total with part of the proceeds from a 401(k) rollover. At the $908 per share price I sold at, that&#39;s a realized profit of almost $35,000! It&#39;s may not be life-changing money, but it&#39;s an incredible return nonetheless ,Now i am working with 3 asset Gold silver and crypto all are good , but Crypto Investment is the mother of them all , Crypto has followed this pattern for sometime now; It dips and gets everyone scared then after retesting an old resistance several times, we wake up one day to see it is bullish. This period is the perfect time to buy the dip and accumulate irrespective of the bulls being under pressure. Bitcoin moving up is inevitable and would see the price of bitcoin surpass it&#39;s all-time highs. The reversal was imminent because obviously, the bitcoin market needed a correction to gather the right momentum to give the bulls more steam and this just makes it the perfect time to invest and accumulate as much as possible. I&#39;d strongly advise any newbie/traders to buy the dip for traders who are still wondering whether to enter the market or old time traders who are Holders to seek help from not just any trader but an established trading expert with at least 89% trade accuracy. I underwent a series of trading losses I&#39;d best not talk about before I was introduced to trading analyst Mr Edgar Jenkin. My contact with him has been the Hallmark of this year for me, under his careful guide and his signal service I&#39;ve been able to recover my losses and even grow my trading portfolio massively from 1.2 btc to 4.6 btc in just 5 weeks.

"Million Dollar Potential in Ruvol<br><br>I have invented a Board Game [still unpublished and not yet out in the market] that is guaranteed to be far more challenging and exciting than CHESS. I called it �RUVOL.� <br><br>Over time, Ruvol will surpass chess as the �Number One Board Game in the World.� <br><br>Why am I so sure about this? Because I am an avid chess player myself. <br><br>The weakness of chess is it always starts in fixed positions that the opening moves become �memorizable.� In fact, not a few have so mastered the moves that they can play against their opponents �blindfolded.� It is for this very reason that the great Bobby Fischer introduced his so-called �Fischer Random Chess,� where the starting position of the pieces is �randomized� to make the memorization of openings impracticable. Fortunately, it is also for this reason that I invented Ruvol where �every game� has been calculated to be a challenging one to play.<br><br>HOW IS RUVOL PLAYED?<br><br>Ruvol is played somewhat like chess. It is played by two players. It uses a board that is rectangular in shape but containing more number of squares than chess. It has equal number of pieces on each side of the board, where each type of piece moves in distinct ways. However, if the way to win chess is to checkmate the opponent�s king, the way to win Ruvol is to be able to cross a designated line. <br><br>But there�s one big advantage Ruvol has over chess: The Ruvol pieces are randomly placed at the start of �every game� which makes it impossible for any clever player to memorize the moves. It is the players themselves who dictate the starting positions of their pieces, depending on the strategies they have planned before the start of each game. Hardly would the starting positions of one player be the same as the starting positions of his/her opponent in every game.<br><br>Ruvol was intended to give chess a direct �apple-to-apple� competition. At present, there is no other board game in the world within the same category of chess �where chess players can switch to.� Chess is totally a monopoly in its class. Chess players can now have an alternative in Ruvol.<br><br>A MILLION DOLLAR POTENTIAL IN RUVOL<br><br>The people who play chess will be the same people who will play Ruvol. In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world. These 800 million players comprise the �Total Potential Buyers� of Ruvol across the globe. At an average profit of just US$3 per set, the �Global Income Potential� of Ruvol then is US$2.4 billion. Assuming only 1% of it will buy each year, the annual global potential sale of Ruvol is US$24M.<br><br>I AM SELLING MY COPYRIGHT TO RUVOL. <br><br>For the reason that I don�t have the resources to publish Ruvol on a global scale, I find it �wiser� to simply sell my copyright. <br><br>If you similarly see the great potential in Ruvol and wanted to buy my copyright, I will be very glad to receive your BEST PRICE OFFER via email.
